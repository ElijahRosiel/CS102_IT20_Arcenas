Ces crayons ne sont pas les moins chers que l'on puisse trouver, mais le prix est plus que largement compensé par leur qualité. Ces crayons sont solides, tant la partie bois que la parie graphite. Si ils tombent, la mine intérieure ne casse pas comme c'est le cas sur les crayons bas de gamme. Lors de la taille, le bois est proprement coupé par la lame du taille crayon, au lieu d'être déchiqueté comme c'est le cas aussi avec les produits bas de gamme. Le graphite utilisé est de qualité, permettant un taillage pointu ou plus rond. La qualité d'écriture est bien là: ça ne bave pas, on réalise des tracés précis.Idéal aussi bien pour les adultes que pour les enfants, qui ont tendance à les faire tomber fréquemment et à les tailler souvent !","Reviewed in France on 12 February 2016","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Este paquete de 5 lápices de dureza variada es la herramienta perfecta para aquellos que amamos dibujar, tomar notas o simplemente disfrutar de la escritura a mano.✅ Nuestra Experiencia 🔧:Desde que adquirí este set de lápices, los he utilizado en diversas ocasiones y los resultados han sido sobresalientes.

Meine bisherigen Bleistifte hatten die ""nette"" Angewohnheit, dass wenn sie einmal zu Boden gefallen waren, die Mine innerhalb des Bleistiftes mehrfach gebrochen war. Also war der Stift immer nur wenige Millimeter anspitzbar, bis dann die Mine wieder eine Bruchstelle frei gab. Nicht diese Stifte! Auch nach x-maligen Herunterfallen (in der Werkstatt leider ein normales Geschehen) brach die Mine noch bei keinem der Stifte! Die Dinger scheinen unzerstörbar! Abgesehen davon liegen sie gut in der Hand, und durch die auffällige Farbgebung finde ich sie auch im Werkstattchaos relativ einfach. Aber auch beim normalen Schreibgebrauch sind diese Stifte wirklich toll. Der Abrieb der Mine ist relativ gering, so dass man nicht alle paar Sätze lang wieder nachspitzen muss. Nur eine Kleinigkeit, aber auch erwähnenswert: die Stifte kamen wunderbar gespitzt an. Also: klasse Bleistifte!","Reviewed in Germany on 25 March 2018","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"221","BIC Evolution Graphite Pencils - Box of 12 - HB Lead with Colourful Striped Design - Wood-Free and Splinter-Proof, Yellow,Green,Pink,Red,Black","Serh gute Bleistifte","P. und G. Arentzen","Schon die alten Ägypter nutzten Blei, um wichtige und weniger wichtige Informationen festzuhalten. Und das vor über 5.000 Jahren.Bis zum heutigen Bleistift war es freilich ein weiter Weg und ich fürchte, dass keine weltbewegenden Dokumente mit ihnen unterzeichnet, wohl aber womöglich konzipiert wurden.Heute sind Bleistifte in den meisten Haushalten zu finden und ganz sicher findet man sie im Mäppchen von Schülern aller Altersstufen.Die hier vorliegenden Evolution-Bleistifte von BIC kommen gänzlich ohne Holz aus. Sie sind sechseckig,  bestehen aus Kunstharz, sind komplett durchgefärbt und kommen in der Stärke HB daher.In einer Blister-Verpackung ruhen vier Stück; braucht man sie nicht alle, muss man sich also einen guten Aufbewahrungsort ausdenken.Dank ihrer Form liegen sie gut in der Hand. Auch Kinder – Testobjekt war hier meine siebenjährige Enkelin – konnte gut damit malen und schreiben.Anfangs hatte ich aufgrund von Material und Form ein wenig Angst, die Stifte könnten sich nicht gut spitzen lassen.  Aber diese Angst war unbegründet - in einem normalen Spitzer lassen sich die Spitzer mühelos spitzen.Hat man die Kinder , dann weiß man eines - sie lassen die Stifte fallen, und schon brechen die Minen. Dies ist hier anders, wie ein Bruchtest ergab. Auch mehrfaches Hinunterwerfen ließ die Minen nicht splittern.Fazit: Farbenfroh, gut zu handhaben und stabil – besser geht es nicht! Diese Bleistifte gehören in jedes Mäppchen, machen aber aufgrund ihrer Optik auch in Büros einen guten Eindruck.","Reviewed in Germany on 4 March 2019","4.6 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Sehr praktisch finde ich die bruchfeste Mine. Durch sie ist es nicht dramatisch, wenn die Stifte mal hinfallen. Gerade bei Schulkindern ist dies Gold wert. Das Schreibverhalten lässt jedoch zu Wünschen übrig. So muss im Vergleich mit Bleistiften anderer Hersteller fest aufgedrückt werden, um „Farbe“ auf das Papier zu bekommen. Besonders auf glatterem Papier wie bei Schulbüchern fällt dies auf. Zum Aufzeichnen von Umrissen mit Hilfe von Schablonen auf Tonpapier, gefallen mir die Stifte dagegen gut. Auch wegradieren ist kein Problem.","Reviewed in Germany on 17 January 2019","4.6 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Ich arbeite an technischen Zeichnungen und zeichne/skizziere privat sehr gerne damit. Durch die sogenannten ""Fall-Druckbleistift - Minen"" benötigt man keinen Spitzer, man arbeitet immer mit derselben Linienstärke. Zudem befindet sich am Ende unter dem Druckknopf ein kleiner Radiergummi. Dieser ist mir erst nach längerem Gebrauch aufgefallen und wirklich praktisch.Wer auf Qualität setzen möchte ist hier genau am richtigen Produkt! Lediglich die 3,5mm Minen brechen sehr schnell, wenn man diese zu weit herausfährt oder zu feste aufdrückt.

The 0.7 and 0.5 work fine. The 0.35 was problematic. The lead (graphite) inside constantly broke when pressing the top to reveal more of the 0.35 lead, and it intermittently slipped back into the barrel of the pencil when you finally get the lead to emerge and put it to paper. I Had to remove bits of the broken lead (and the other two leads inside the pencil), make sure no small lengths left inside, then very carefully insert a single 0.35 lead and started again. This problem seems to be solved - so far - now that there is only one 0.35 lead in the pencil. This is a mechanical issue, not the leads in the pencils. These are excellent and produce smooth and consistent marks on the paper used.

Ces crayons ne sont pas les moins chers que l'on puisse trouver, mais le prix est plus que largement compensé par leur qualité. Ces crayons sont solides, tant la partie bois que la parie graphite. Si ils tombent, la mine intérieure ne casse pas comme c'est le cas sur les crayons bas de gamme. Lors de la taille, le bois est proprement coupé par la lame du taille crayon, au lieu d'être déchiqueté comme c'est le cas aussi avec les produits bas de gamme. Le graphite utilisé est de qualité, permettant un taillage pointu ou plus rond. La qualité d'écriture est bien là: ça ne bave pas, on réalise des tracés précis.Idéal aussi bien pour les adultes que pour les enfants, qui ont tendance à les faire tomber fréquemment et à les tailler souvent !","Reviewed in France on 12 February 2016","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Por lo tanto lo recomiendo sin lugar a duda.Sobre el subrayador, decir que funciona perfectamente. Realiza un trazo uniforme y sin fallos. Algo que me ha gustado mucho es el hecho de que la tapa quede perfectamente cerrada, incluso hay que hacer algo de fuerza, esto garantiza que la punta esté en perfecto estado en cada uso y que no se seque.A este producto le voy a poner 5 estrellas, por su calidad y precio.

Molto nera e quasi ""grassa"", è poco cancellabile come se fosse una matita colorata ed in breve è diventata la mia preferita (allego la palette dell'intero set, a lato di un piccolo bozzetto che feci tempo fa per esemplificare l'uso delle varie gradazioni di grafite).È allora che sono venuto a conoscenza di questo nuovo tipo di matite della Staedtler, sempre Mars Lumograph ma di tipo ""Black"", anch'esse in grafite ma di colore molto più nero del normale per la presenza di una più alta percentuale di carbone; vedendole in vendita qui su Amazon, le ho acquistate per curiosità.Fatta esclusione per la 8B del set Mars Lumograph ""normale"" che è del tutto simile con la 8B di tipo ""Black"", le altre gradazioni non sono da confondere però, in quanto a resa grafica, né con quelle in normale grafite né con le matite a carboncino.Delle prime non hanno quei fastidiosi riflessi lucidi avendo una finitura opaca, e delle seconde non possiedono la friabilità propria del carbone.Sono pastose e poco cancellabili come se fossero delle matite colorate nere, ma a differenza di queste sono sfumabili anche con le dita, hanno una mina resistentissima e molto affilabile, e soprattutto sono di quattro gradazioni diverse: la confezione comprende due matite di gradazione 2B, due 4B, una 6B e una 8B.Io le uso spesso e con piacere perché queste matite Black consentono agli amanti di questo tipo di tecnica, semplicemente ripassando un sottile strato sulle zone fatte con la grafite normale dove si vuole che sia reso un nero più profondo, di attenuare anche l'effetto lucido tipico della grafite.Queste Mars Lumograph Black sono un complemento anche per chi ama disegnare con il carboncino: le rifiniture, i particolari e le ombre più scure possono essere aggiunte con profitto dopo la stesura del fissatore ottenendo risultati molto convincenti.Allego tra le immagini il confronto tra la matita Lumograph in normale grafite di gradazione 8B e la sua ""gemella"" 8B Lumograph Black: entrambe hanno la mina di diametro maggiore delle altre gradazioni: ben 4,5 mm., mentre per le Black 6B, 4B e 2B il diametro è di 3,6.Le Mars Lumograph Black sono contenute in una pratica scatola metallica con una funzionale cerniera apribile (molto comoda per coloro che disegnano sovente anche all'aperto o in altre svariate condizioni ambientali), ed inoltre, al di là dell'abituale eleganza, riportano intelligentemente su ognuna delle sei facce la gradazione (caratteristica comodissima per un disegnatore).Consiglio a tutti gli appassionati di disegno, professionisti e non, l'acquisto delle Lumograph black, perché la resa è in definitiva qualcosa di diverso: diverso dalle grafiti, diverso dai carboncini, diverso dalle matite colorate. Si ha un ibrido di cui davvero si sentiva la mancanza a livello grafico.P.S.:Ora che sto scrivendo noto che ne hanno prodotto un kit in cui le matite Lumograph Black sono tutte di gradazioni diverse, avendo aggiunto la HB e la 7B: le acquisterò non appena ""nanizzate"" queste.Spero di esservi stato utile.","Reviewed in Italy on 27 June 2019","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"372","STAEDTLER 100B G6 Mars Lumograph Pencils, Black, Pack of 6","Great art pencils","Debi","The original Staedtler Lumograph 7B (EB) was always my favorite but the 7B & 8B (EE) never quite fit in with the rest of the Lumograph drawing pencils, they were a carbon & graphite mix while the rest of the grades are graphite. Having them split into two lines gives so much more options. They are nice & dark, as dark as Cretacolor Neros & darker than Faber Castell Matte but not as smooth as either, you can feel just a bit of grab on the paper. You can erase but minimally & smudging/blending with stumps or tortillons is also minimal but that helps make sketchbook drawings stay less messy. This is a great & useful addition to any drawing toolkit.","Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

They are very black, not grey and leave no graphite shine.I do not use these for skin or shading because they don't blend out well. This isn't necessarily a bad thing. There are parts you don't want to smudge,  like eyelashes.I use caran d'ache grafwood for my skin as they are very soft and blend out well. Not great for detail though. Then I use Faber-Castell pitt matte pencils for most other parts of a drawing.Using all 3 brands enables me to get the best of them all.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"379","STAEDTLER 100B G6 Mars Lumograph Pencils, Black, Pack of 6","Paying a little more is worth it","Leslie W.","Amazon carries plenty of no-name and budget brand pencil sets, cheap, and they are usually fine. I have bought several without regret. But spending just a few dollars more for a box of Staedtlers is worth it. I do think they sharpen better with less lead breakage and last longer, but that could be me just getting better at sharpening (yes, there is a knack to it). The nicest touch is how the hardness value is imprinted on all six faces of the hexagon, so you can locate the one you want without having to rotate pencils to see the label. I don't know of any other pencil brand that has this. Remember that there are two different 12-packs--this one, which is mostly softer leads, and another that emphasizes the harder ones. Amazon can be overpriced for some art supplies, but not here--this is a very good price for this product compared to art stores and other online sellers. I might stock up!","Reviewed in Canada on 8 April 2019","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Bien por vaguería o porque soy demasiado principiante para darme cuenta, voy buscando un tipo de lápiz que me permita negros intensos, pero que luego no tenga que andar con fijadores para que no se me vaya o se traspase a la hoja de al lado. Los Conté igual se acercaban un poco pero siguen manchando allá por donde pasan.Estos cayeron en mis manos después de ver varios análisis. Al principio me resultaba algo extraña la sensación, ya que no son suaves como un grafito, son como una cera dura, pero los resultados me gustaron mucho. Alcanzan negros mucho más intensos que un grafito (aunque el Steadtler normal 8B no está nada mal) y no tienes ese brillo del grafito que puede ser molesto. A medida que los usas y te acostumbras vas obteniendo mejores resultados y te van gustando más. Se quedan bastante bien en el papel, no difuminan mal, no manchan ni necesitan de fijador. La cajita donde vienen en un buen detalle y el precio por 6 lápices está muy bien.Un excelente producto que va a gustar a los amantes del dibujo a lápiz.","Reviewed in Spain on 11 April 2018","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"
"385","STAEDTLER 100B G6 Mars Lumograph Pencils, Black, Pack of 6","Iconic pencil","E. V.","These are excellent premium quality pencils by Staedtler for sketching. There are 12 x 8mm pencils in total ranging from 2H to 8B. The degrees of softness are: 2H, H, F, HB, B, 2B, 3B, 4B, 5B, 6B, 7B, 8B. They are presented in a nice metal tin which provides good protection and easy access. The highly distinctive blue, silver and black top livery is iconic and it hasn't changed in years.I have used these pencils before and they have never let me down. This set is excellent for building up tone in portrait or landscape sketches for example. They sharpen well without splintering, and are comfortable to hold and use. The graphite is super smooth on paper and does not scratch at all like cheaper pencils. The graphite also erases easily so you can perfect your work. There is something very nice and satisfying about a good quality pencil like this one. This is a great set for any artist or student alike.

"393","STAEDTLER 100B G6 Mars Lumograph Pencils, Black, Pack of 6","“These are real artist grade pencils.”","steffdn","I hope I’m not the only one that wanted to see a comparison between these and the Faber Pitt-Matte set. I would first like to say I’m a fan of both brands but neither is my all time favorite brand, so I sway neither direction in a biased opinion.  So let’s begin. After a scale hardness check, these pencils were exactly on scale where they are claiming to be. Paint on these pencils are very nice. While holding them, they feel exactly like the regular Lumos. And after a few hours of testing these, I will admit that these are better than the regular Lumograph set, and they are slightly above the faber-9000 series, however, they fall short of being as good as the faber Pitt-Matte set.  Why?  Well they just don’t have that matte charcoal finish that the Pitt set is able to achieve. I have also did a review on that set if you happen to stumble across it here on Amazon.  Listen, don’t get me wrong, these pencils are definitely in a serious race here. And could possibly be in the top 5th or 6th place of the best woodcase pencils being made. And I don’t have to tell you there are thousands of wood case pencil companies. Hundreds of them claiming to be the best artist grade pencils.  If you can make it into the top 10 on my list, your pencils are definitely worth buying. And these Lumo Blacks are definitely on my list. These are the types of pencils that make you want to draw. I know you are not bound down to artistic creativity by tools, however, any artist will tell you, you can only get as good as the tool will let you.  So when you by cheap supplies, your progress will only go so far before you must upgrade to better supplies or your abilities will fall short of your capable talents.  ...A set like this will not only help you achieve better work, but will also make you strive to push them and yourself to higher levels of progression. I definitely suggest buying this set and testing them out for yourself. Or if you are also a collector like myself, add this set into your collection. I always buy 2 sets of every pencil so I will always have a brand new set to put into my massive pencil collection.

"501","Mechanical pencil Pentel PG1013-E GraphGear1000, line width 0.3 mm, rubber (Z2-1N), 1 piece","Quality mechanical pencil","Ian Ward","I’ve been using the 0.7 model for many years. Totally my go-to writing tool. It’s so-well made, easy to write with, well balanced in the hand etc. I like that there’s the option to set a visual at the top that reminds you what grade of lead you are using. I always use Pentel Ain Stein refills, and always 2B, but that’s not a fact I hold in my head every day, so when I go to order refills the “2B” reference is useful.This is my go-to tool for writing notes at work. And has been for years.What I don’t like - it’s quite long, even after clicking the button to retract the nib. Having said that, it still fits in any case or bag that in which I transport it.Other things - give it good quality lead. It works brilliantly with Pentel Ain Stein leads. They’re smooth when laying down text (I don’t have any experience of drawing with this tool)When I first got it I used whatever 0.7 leads I had to hand, and it was awful. The above Pentel leads are now available a lot cheaper - and are significantly better.Hope that helps in your purchasing decision. I have amassed quite a ‘collection’ of mechanical pencils including Rotring etc, but this one is totally the best. Not just slightly better- a lot better. My ‘collection’ isn’t really a planned collection- it’s stuff I’ve bought over the years on the journey to find a really decent mechanical pencil.Pentel Ain Stein Leads are equally key, in any pencil. Very smooth.","Reviewed in Australia on 14 April 2024","4.7 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

While I haven’t had the luxury of owning a Rotring or a super-high end pencil, I did use regular plastic mechanical pencils for years; the kind of cheap pencil that come in packs of 50. This pencil blows them out of the water, in every aspect except one (which I will get to).PROS:- well balanced, weight feels good when writing- the thing is a marvel of craftsmanship. Seriously, I’m still amazed at how much stuff they crammed into it- the extending barrel is convenient, doesn’t have much play- you can press down with a LOT of force before the lead recedes into the barrel- the grip is greatCONS- The eraser. As someone who has to erase mistakes constantly, the size of the eraser is laughable and didn’t last me two weeks. Luckily it comes with replacements, however they also don’t last long..-the end cap. I tried like hell not to lose it, but it’s just too easy to lose if you’re using the eraser","Reviewed in Sweden on 13 April 2024","3.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"516","Mechanical pencil Pentel PG1013-E GraphGear1000, line width 0.3 mm, rubber (Z2-1N), 1 piece","Pentel Graphgear 1000 (0,3 mm)","Groumi","Die Rezension bezieht sich auf den Pentel Graphgear 1000 mit Minenstärke 0,3 mmGrundlegend positiv hervorzuheben ist die hohe Verarbeitungsqualität: Das massive Metallgehäuse macht einen ausgesprochen stabilen und wertigen Eindruck. Das Finish des Stiftes ist mattsilber, während der Taschenclip und Teile des Druckmechanismus glänzend gehalten sind. Die Griffzone ist mit einer sehr feinen, rautenförmigen Maserung auf dem Metall und Silikonnoppen versehen. Die Maserung wirkt nicht ausgefranst oder unpräzise gefräst - ganz im Gegenteil -, was den guten Eindruck bezüglich der allgemeinen Verarbeitungsqualität bestätigt. An der Griffzone ist zudem eine Vorrichtung angebracht, bei der durch Drehen die verwendete Minenstärke angezeigt werden kann. Teile des Innenlebens bestehen aus (massivem) Kunststoff.Sobald der Taschenclip gedrückt wird, fährt die Spitze des Bleistifts vollständig in das Gehäuse zurück, was ebenfalls einen sehr positiven Eindruck hinterlässt - hierdurch wird einerseits Verhindert, dass Kleidung durch den Graphitstaub der Mine verschmutzt werden kann (beim Transport in der Hemdtasche z. B.) und andererseits wird die Spitze des Stiftes so beim Transport sicher vor Beschädigungen geschützt. Der Federmechanismus des Taschenclips ist auf jeden Fall stark genug, um ein versehentliches Auslösen der Transportsicherung zu verhindern.Unter der Kappe des Druckmechanismus ist ein Radiergummi angebracht. Dieser ist ca. 2 cm lang, kann also bei ""Verbrauch"" nach oben nachgeschoben werden (zum präzisen Radieren gibt es natürlich auch Radierstifte - diese sind nicht teuer, ich habe mir gleich einen mitbestellt). Im Inneren des Stiftes ist am Ende des Radiergummis ein ca. 2 cm langer Metallstab in Minenstärke angebracht. Er dient dazu, ggf. abgebrochene Minenreste aus der Spitze des Stiftes zu entfernen, sehr nützlich.Wer mit günstigeren Druckbleistiften gearbeitet hat, kennt sicherlich das Problem, dass die Mine ""zu weit"" vorgeschoben wird - und gerade bei festerem Aufdrücken oder der Verwendung dünner Minen gerne abbricht. Bei diesem Stift ist das anders: Es wird genug der Mine vorgeschoben, um den Stift kontinuierlich benutzen zu können, aber nicht so viel, dass die Mine bei der Benutzung abbricht. Für die intensive Arbeit auf jeden Fall sehr angenehm (zum Vergleich: Bei einem günstigeren Druckbleistift eines namhaften Herstellers wird bei einmaliger Betätigung die Mine ca. 4x weiter vorgeschoben als beim Graphgear).Für meinen Geschmack dürfte der Stift etwas ""kopflastiger"" sein, die Gewichtsverteilung liegt - meiner Meinung nach - nicht weit genug vorne. Das fällt beim Gebrauch allerdings kaum auf. Im Gegensatz zu (Voll-)Kunststoffstiften ist der Graphgear 1000 (natürlich) merklich schwerer.Einziger Kritikpunkt ist der Reibwiderstand auf der Griffzone: Im Gegensatz zu gummierten Stiften (hier im Vergleich zum Rotring Tikky) muss mehr Kraft aufgewendet werden, um den Stift sicher zu führen, da er sich etwas ""rutschig"" anfühlt. Das ist mit Sicherheit auch Gewöhnungssache, jedoch hätten die Silikonnoppen aus diesem Grund für meinen Geschmack etwas weiter aus dem Metall der Griffzone herausstehen dürfen (sie schließen gefühlt fast bündig mit der Metalloberfläche ab).Gerade wegen der guten Verarbeitungsqualität und dem angenehmen Arbeiten (Stichwort: Vorschub der Mine) bleibt es dennoch bei der guten Bewertung.","Reviewed in France on 11 September 2013","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"521","Mechanical pencil Pentel PG1013-E GraphGear1000, line width 0.3 mm, rubber (Z2-1N), 1 piece","Great feel. Great value. Great warrantee.","Ian Ward","I've bought 3 of these so far on separate occasions (all the 0.9 mm yellow version).  One was a gift for my 10 yo son, who kept borrowing mine, and won't write with anything else now.I love how this pencil feels in my hand and while writing. It is very well engineered, nicely balanced, and has a smooth mechanism. The auto-retracting mechanism when you clip in on you pocket is a nice touch. All around great design. I've only purchased the yellow one (0.9mm, HB lead) because I planned on mostly using it for marking wood for my woodworking projects and so needed the stronger/thicker lead, but I find myself writing with it all the time. It's just that pleasant to use.I had a problem with one of them (it broke at the yellow plastic part), and I contacted the Pantel warranty department since it was well past the 30 day Amazon return. It took them a while to respond (7-10 days, I forget) so I was initially concerned, but they responded saying they would send a new one and a label for me to return the broken one. Which they did, no questions, no hassle. Top marks for their customer service. Very happy.There are two things that could be better:1) There is one plastic piece in an otherwise all metal product. It is a weak point, and in fact where one of my pencils broke. But the customer service/warranty department has been great, so I guess if they continue like that (it has a lifetime warranty!), I can't complain too much.2) The clip is just folded metal and could be a bit sharp on clothes. This is actually a pretty common construction for clips on pencils and pens alike, but for $20+ I was hoping for better. I carry one of them with me pretty much at all times, so I'm a bit concerned the clip eventually will cut into the cloth. So far it hasn't, so I my concern might not be justified. Time will tell and I will try to update in 6+ months either way.Also, one thing I wish they had communicated more clearly: In order to set the handy lead hardness indicator, first loosen the conical end piece part. The indicator part should then spin feely. Make your selection and tighten it back up. (Finger tight is sufficient.)I got all of mine on sale around $13-$16. At that price you really can't beat the value. Full price is $23+, which might seem pricey for a pencil, but if you don't lose it, it should last you a very long time. I think it's well worth it even at full price if you value an affordable, quality writing/drafting pencil. (If you're prone to losing pencils, though, then your experience might vary. :-) )I highly recommend this pencil. (And seeing as I've bought this on 3 occasions, it goes without saying that I'd buy it again.)","Reviewed in Australia on 14 April 2024","4.7 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"524","Mechanical pencil Pentel PG1013-E GraphGear1000, line width 0.3 mm, rubber (Z2-1N), 1 piece","MORE great pencils from the makers of many of my favorites!","Andrzej Krupski","SUMMARY:  All in all, I find this gift set a wonderful combination of great pencils, spare leads and erasers presented in a very classy box.CONTEXT:  The P-200 series of Pentel pencils have been favorites of mine for over 40 years, introduced to me by my engineer father, I used them from college (80's) on through my business career for drawing, note taking and sketching, and I still have the .3, .5, .7 and .9mm sizes on my desk today.REVIEWS: When I saw this Pentel GraphGear1000 Premium Gift Set, I immediately went to YouTube and started watching video reviews. Most were favorable, so I decided to treat myself to an early Christmas gift. I'm VERY happy I did.FEATURES: If the P200 series are light, nimble, no frills, highly effective pencil companions, the GG1000 series are their full-featured, sophisticated siblings. GRIP:  Even more comfortable in my hands than the P200 series (though the weightier feel might not be for everyone), the combination of knurled metal sleeve and rubber ellipses make a firm grip comfortable. CLIP:  The clip is a combination of a) very well-designed way to clip the pencil to pocket or note-pad, and also b) when the back of the clip is pressed, it serves to retract the lead-sleeve back into the tip ... this is not a trivial point. RETRACTABLE LEAD SLEEVE: One of the few disappointing experiences I've ever had with a P-203 (.3mm) was when the slender lead sleeve became bent ... a small bit of damage that rendered it useless. Retracting the lead sleeve back into the point not only protects the sleeve from damage, but also protects the pockets into which we thrust our pencils. A great idea. PUSH BUTTON TOP/ERASER/SLEEVE CLEANER/LEAD MAGAZINE:  The push button cap at the top of the pencil a) extends and allows the retraction of the lead into the lead sleeve, b) hides the combination eraser and sleeve cleaning needle (stuck into the bottom of eraser), and c) covers the lead magazine (under the eraser).  LEAD TYPE WINDOW:  Above the knurled grip is a rotatable window that allows the user to display the lead type they're currently using.FINER POINTS:> I've heard that setting the lead-grade window requires a slight loosening of the grip, but I haven't tried that yet. The video I watched made perfect sense of this, so if/when it comes up, I'll update the review here.> Those who prefer a very light weight pencil might find these too heavy. I like the weight feel.> The Gift Box is done well enough I've been using consistently, replacing each pencil in the box after every use.","Reviewed in Poland on 9 March 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"537","Mechanical pencil Pentel PG1013-E GraphGear1000, line width 0.3 mm, rubber (Z2-1N), 1 piece","The best mechanical pencil you are likely to come across","Mayron Menezes","In short: Fulfils all criteria to guarantee an excellent product experience.Looks: I have lost track of how many years I have had mine (best part of a decade now). They still look the business and are often asked about by my clients whilst I am using them. One was even stolen, so I suppose that makes them quite desirable.Construction: The retractable tip is just perfect. It has a slight springiness to it that not only cushions the writing/drawing experience, but also helps avoid lead breakages, although the modern hi-poly' refills are pretty good in their own right. Made principally of plastic and aluminium, it is light yet very robust. The combination of a knurled section and rubber grip is perfect - no readjustment or sweaty finger problems. There are no fancy gears that turn the lead around (as advertised by other products) neither have I ever thought to myself that I need one of those - one less unnecessary mechanism that can go wrong = minimalism = long-lasting = happy owner.Use: Always works well, very easy to carry around (very light). Solid enough construction to withstand severe punishment - mine has been submerged in water for ~3 days (flood while I was away) & dropped from a height of over 10m (~30ft) - accidentally dropped in the space between staircase - which obliterated the lead refills inside but the pen works just fine. If it was the cheaper plastics varieties of mechanical pencils then they would not have survived. I'm also sure that some of the more expensive varieties will not be able to boast this. Even if it did stop working, replacing them is not going to be too painful. As testament to how well these have worked, I now have 3 varieties of these that take different refill sizes, as well as a spare 0.5mm as my all-rounder when I have to jot down or explain anything on the go. The oldest one is pushing a decade in age and looks/works like new. [For the astute fans out there: yes, they did make minor changes in their construction over the years, but not to any detriment]Conclusion: I have never been let down, only pleasantly surprised. I would highly recommend this over any other product I have tried (including comparisons against other brands that are >4x more expensive). A fantastic product that offers excellent value and many years of great service. This product has never disappointed me and I'm certain that most will agree once they have had the pleasure of using it.","Reviewed in Brazil on 7 January 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"540","Mechanical pencil Pentel PG1013-E GraphGear1000, line width 0.3 mm, rubber (Z2-1N), 1 piece","The only pen for me!","RAY","This is my absolute favorite pencil as an artist, and the only one I've used for quite a few years. I got one in high school and used it for four years, until I was a college sophomore. It stood up to daily note taking and drawing for four years. In the end, the only flaw in this pencil is the plastic seam, since that is what broke. Still, four years is an exceptionally long time for one pencil to last, especially since it is the only one I used for those four years. I purchased a second one right after the first one broke, and that one is still in excellent condition a year later.This is an excellent pencil for any artist, but has been especially wonderful for me, as someone with bad joints. The grip is bigger than a standard mechanical pencil, so it isn't as painful to write for long periods of time, and the silicone ovals make it easy to keep your grip on it.Retracting the tip of the pencil with the clip is a unique feature of this pencil, and honestly a bit of a fun party trick. People are always surprised by it. I have never had problems with the clip wearing out or breaking, and since the tip is retractable, I haven't had it break or bend either.","Reviewed in Canada on 11 September 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"544","Mechanical pencil Pentel PG1013-E GraphGear1000, line width 0.3 mm, rubber (Z2-1N), 1 piece","By far my favorite mechanical pencil","decentandre","I like this pencil so much, I purchased all 5 sizes this time: 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9.  My favorite lead is 2B.  It's softer and much darker than the standard HB. H=Hard. The lead range is 4H, 3H...to HB, B...3B, 4B.  When I'm checking construction sites, I use 0.9 to write erasable info on wood, walls, and other materials, wet or dry, regardless of temperatures. Not so with Sharpies and wax pencils. In the office, I use 0.5 and 0.7 for paperwork, blueprints, etc. The British all-time favorite is 0.4. I use the 0.3 for adding tiny details to building drawings and it matches my love for 0.38 gel-ink (ultra-fine) pens.GraphGear 1000s are great mechanical pencils. The only ones with fully retractable pencil points. I use Pentel Clicking erasers instead of the endcaps. It seems like too much work to stop writing, pull-off the endcap, erase, then put it back on. In half that time, I've grabbed an eraser and done.  I had the same problem with the 0.7 pencil breaking like a couple of other Amazon reviewers. That blue ring in the middle of the pencil is plastic, which I didn't know until I found my pencil broken. Easy fix though. I put the two pieces back together and taped it super tight with black electrical tape - the good stuff (3M Temflex). Temflex is very durable, stretches a little, resistant to both water and extreme temperatures. 4 weeks later, my pencil still works like new and looks good. I kind of like the black tape. It's one more way of knowing which pencils are mine. Electrical tape comes in many colors. I plan to tape my other pencils too. So far, my new replacement 0.7 is not needed.NOTE: The price of lead refills varies a lot across Amazon. Also, Pentel has two sources. Ain Pentel is from Japan. I'm guessing the other is from China. ROtring, Staedtler, and Mars are brands well-known by engineers, architects, and draftsmen.  Faber-Castell is well-known in the art world. Presently, I trying Mr. Pen because I really like their gel highlighters and lower prices. So far, no complaints. But I have both Ain Pentel and Pentel waiting in the wings. Also, I don't care about the little bar code sticker on all my pencils because my hands never touch it except during lead refilling. Buy the GraphGear 1000. It's pricey but worth it if you write with pencil a lot.","Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

J'ai quand même fini par en acheter un deuxième (0,5mm et 0,7mm). Il est très confortable en main. Il a le long tube en métal pour servir de crayon technique. Et le tube se rétractera dans le corps du crayon une fois le clip utilisé.Bien sûr, cela aurait été bien d'avoir ce que les autres stylos ont aujourd'hui : la possibilité d'auto-alimenter la mine sans appuyer sur le bouton au bout, ou en secouant le stylo.La seule chose qui manque est la petite épingle généralement attachée à la gomme qui aide dans les rares cas où la mine est coincée dans le stylo.Une bonne addition est le curseur qui permet à l'utilisateur de régler l'indicateur de dureté du plomb. Ainsi, lorsque vous avez plusieurs stylos avec plusieurs pistes, on peut facilement dire s'il s'agit d'un HB ou d'un 4B.C'est aussi bien que Pentel ait des codes de couleur pour les stylos, donc le gris signifie 0,5 mm de plomb, le bleu signifie 0,7 mm de plomb, et ainsi de suite.","Reviewed in Germany on 10 April 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"550","Mechanical pencil Pentel PG1013-E GraphGear1000, line width 0.3 mm, rubber (Z2-1N), 1 piece","An Excellent Mechanical Pencil; but improvements theoretically possible","Liv","This is an excellent mechanical pencil.  It's one you buy to keep; not use and dispose of. Undergraduate students looked at it with awe and respect (just kidding there- let's not get carried away).  It's very functional, but not the overt display of opulence of products made by jewelers.It writes very well, and has good balance.  The grip has that knurled surface that prevents it from slipping around when, for example, your hands are wet or dirty.  The action advancing the pencil leads is flawless..  Pencil leads can break when too much lateral pressure is applied, but it requires more than most other mechanical pencils.  The process of refilling leads is good.  No problems there.I like the design of that spring-loaded clip.  You ever find yourself upside-down when you didn't expect it?  It stays put in your shirtpocket or when clipped to your shirt's collar.After ~3-5 years I noticed some corrosion on the barrel of one i purchased.  This occurred after repeated exposure to humidity from being on the bathroom counter near the shower.  You wouldn't have that problem with plastic.  Some of the graphics looked weathered due to wear.  Could the black graphics be etched into the barrel?  Who knows how much a pencil like this would cost, however.The only weakness is that the eraser inside it (underneath the cap) tends to slide back when pressure is applied.  This doesn't happen with the eraser from the factory, but after I installed refills.  The eraser holding bracket just didn't grip enough (anymore) after installing refill erasers.  And so the eraser didn't stay put;' making erasure difficult and frustrating.  I know it's my own fault, with big Trump-like hands.  After putting in a new eraser, I couldn't re-form that bracket exactly again.  I believe that some writers might never use that eraser, opting instead for a separate one.Overall, a great product for those who need better than just a cheap throwaway pencil.","Reviewed in France on 15 November 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"570","Derwent Graphic Soft Graphite Drawing Pencils, Ideal For Illustrating & Shading, Set Of 12, Professional Quality, 34215","Derwents are some of the best around","Mz Nina, business consultant and aspiring artist","I looove this brand, also all their colored pencil lines.  I know everyone is Prismacolor crazy, but it is hype.  Derwents are just as good and I am a little partial to them simply they are the ones I learn to draw with even as a kid.  I remember my first Derwent kit that Dad bought me, 120 pencils and I was around 8 and we were livi9ng in Australia.I love the water color pencils, the graphite, the ink tense that you can actually draw on fabric with and it stays, and the color soft line.  I also have a few others, but those are my favorites.I would say there pencils are as good as any other including Prismacolor.Just make sure to get the right pencil sharpener no matter what you use.  Get a Derwent battery operated, which is still made or a Panasonic or a used HUNT-Boston, all of which are no longer made.  DO NOT GET X-ACTO, it chews your pencils up and constantly breaks the lead.INFO ON ELECTRIC PENCIL SHARPENERS:I am a color pencil artist, and you need to have either a Panasonic, ""Hunt-Boston"" pencil sharpener, otherwise your colored pencils are eaten.  NEVER BUY X-ACTO for colored pencils, X-ACTO will eat your pencils.  Until you can find a Panasonic or Hunt-Boston, or Hunt or Boston electric pencil sharpener, get this if you can find one, or the Derwent ""BLACK"" model as it had 2 holes, one for a longer tip and one for a shorter tip.  I have both.  I had bought the Derwent one as I have Derwent but also use Prismacolor and graphite.  Panasonic and Hunt Boston are NO LONGER MADE no matter WHAT anyone says.  I was lucky to buy a new PANASONIC electric pencil sharpener by trolling the net until I found on.  Bought a used Boston, model #18, used on eBay and paid waaaay too much.  It was pretty beaten up.Also, if you do buy used, get one in the best quality that you can and just pay the extra, I would say up to $35.  I personally would not spend more than that.  I paid $38 for my new Panasonic.Also, X-ACTO bought out ""Hunt-Boston"" and all new models are a 4 digit model number, the actual ""Hunt-Boston"" is only a 2 digit.  This issue is that X-ACTO still sells under the Hunt Boston name, and it is misleading as it now uses X-ACTO cutters, which do NOTHING but EAT your pencils.  I also do not like it when someone lies about what they are selling.I bought what I thought was a ""HUNT"" electric pencil sharpener, it came in a box that had the Hunt name and packaging, but when I opened it up it was a, you guessed right...  An X-ACTO!!  Said so right on the sharpener.Bought on line here at Amazon from Overstock.com, but I returned it and got a refund, including shipping as they were misleading.Hope this helps with those of you who are colored pencil artist.  Get a PANASONIC, HUNT-BOSTON or Derwent sharpener.Also, run a graphite pencil through your sharpener first thing every day and it will stay sharp longer since colored pencils are waxy and tend to build up on the cutters.","Reviewed in the United States on 18 February 2013","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

So I did more comparisons of 8h and 9h with drawing lines, different shading, etc, and 9h is definitely darker than 8h, but whatever, I at least now know what to expect from both those pencils, probably just a lull in quality assurance that day. So a star off for that, butt other than that, great pencils, will buy again for their great price and (hopefully more reliable) quality.","Reviewed in the United States on 17 December 2015","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

My only gripe is that retail store sell them for more than Amazon does by almost $10-$20 more depending on the pencil count. This is the first tin I have gotten that has a damaged pencil in see photo it doesn’t look like it ruined the core of the pencil thankfully. For some of the reviews that mention only getting them in a tin without a lid and just the bottom shrink wrapped(the only difference is the lid not being there it’s still only the bottom shrink wrapped even if you get a lid not sure why they do that.) I would blame Derwent for that more than Amazon as even retail stores like hobby lobby get tins like that.","Reviewed in the United States on 21 October 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I am taking a drawing class for the first time this semester and the range these pencils give me is great. I've had my teacher tell several other students that their supplies weren't adequate but has always just focused on showing me how to use mine. I don't know too much about pencils but if you're looking for a great starter range I would recommend this set.The only down side I have for the pencils is that the case doesn't allow for easy viewing and the pencils fall out fairly easily. However, I didn't really consider the case a huge deal because it stores them perfectly in transit. I just think it would be nice if the pencils snapped in and had a label along the bottom (not on the pencil) to know which pencil you're grabbing (because the pencils will rotate in the case).","Reviewed in the United States on 4 November 2013","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"622","Faber-Castell - Castell 9000 Art Set Pencil (Pack of 6), Green","I Don't Know How I Learned Without Them","Nikita","I don't know why in the world I waited so long to buy some good drawing pencils! I have been sketching with whatever mechanical pencil I had in my bag for years with very little preference, but the way that my sketches have improved with these pencils has been dramatic! Now I feel comfortable creating full pieces of art in shades of grey, whereas before I would sketch lightly and then use other media to finish the piece. After ten years of sketching with, in retrospect, a highly inferior product, I feel confident that these are just what I needed to take the next step toward improvement.These are very high quality. They arrive sharpened, which is nice, since I'm used to colored pencils that arrive in dozens and take hours to sharpen. They sharpen well with a standard or high quality sharpener, and the graphite (even on the softer pencils) is strong enough to not crack in the barrel (a problem I had with some student grade pencils in high school art class). The case is nice, too, and has a soft matte-like finish to the touch. I imagine it will dent and prove less than perfect if thrust into a backpack pocket full of other materials, but if kept in between notebooks, it probably has a long life ahead of it.I bought a set for my best friend, and she is in love, too. This would make a great gift for any artist in your life, and is a good investment for your own arsenal of supplies if you are an artists as well.","Reviewed in the United States on 24 July 2014","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"631","Faber-Castell - Castell 9000 Art Set Pencil (Pack of 6), Green","Very good pencils, worth the money I spent on them","Mr Reviewer...","Very good pencils. I have used these and found them to be very nice to use.I've compared these to my Derwent graphic set (Medium), and I find these pencils to be better. With eh Derwent ones the lead used to break a lot while sharpening but I never had that issue with these Faber Castell Pencils. These pencils also have sharper edges on the outside so I found them more comfortable to hold and grip. This pencil also weights a little more so they didn't feel almost weightless which is better for me. Through my tests the leads last longer than Derwent too, I don't know why the composition must obviously be different but they do last longer and hold their point a bit better.That's about it really, overall I would recommend these over the Derwent ones I used. That's about it really. Just don't take my review to include colour pencils from the companies as that a different game altogether and I haven't used their coloured pencils, I try to give all brands a fair shot.And although this doesn't matter in terms of performance but the Faber Castell Pnecils look nicer and have a better coating on the pencils themselves. The tin looks nicer too. While this doesn't matter it's a bonus at least since I find the green colour very easy on the eyes and It's one of my favourite colours anyway.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 September 2019","4.8 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

On checking I see that my other FB pencils are in a green tin, so I didn’t get what I wanted.

"651","Bic - Evolution Triangle - Triangular Pencils with Integrated Eraser - HB - Box of 12","Gute Bleistifte im praktischen 12er Set.","Amilya","Versand/Lieferumfang:Die BIC Evolution Triangle HB Dreikant Bleistifte mit Radiergummi im 12er Pack kamen sicher verpackt und heil bei mir an.Funktionalität/Optik/Qualität/Anwendung:Die BIC Evolution Triangle Bleistift eignen sich gut zum zeichnen und schreiben.Sie haben eine blau-metallische Farbe und am Ende einen kleinen Radiergummi.Dieser ist, anders als es oft der Fall ist, qualitativ sogar wirklich gut; weder zu weich, noch zu hart, dass er das Papier verkratzt und schwachen bis mittelstarken Bleistiftaufdruck bekommt er gut weg.Durch den dreieckigen Schaft hat man einen guten und angenehmen Halt- und Schreibkomfort.Die Mine ist sehr bruchfest. Das Spitzen funktioniert durch die 3eckige Form nicht ganz mühelos, wobei er sehr ergiebig ist, sodass nicht so schnell gespitzt werden muss. Die Bleistifte sind holzfrei, bestehen aus Kunstharz und splittern dementsprechend nicht, wenn sie zu Bruch gehen. Außerdem sind sie deshalb kaubeständig.Die Minenstärke beträgt 4,3 mm und der Härtegrad ist HB.Fazit:Gute Bleistifte im praktischen 12er Set. Fürs Schreiben und Zeichnen gleichermaßen gut und für kleinere Fehler auch gleich mit praktischem Radiergummi am Stift. Wirklich gut.Vielen Dank, dass Sie sich die Zeit genommen haben, meine Rezension durchzulesen.Ich hoffe, ich konnte Ihnen bei ihrer Entscheidung behilflich sein. 😊","Reviewed in Germany on 25 November 2019","4.6 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"657","Bic - Evolution Triangle - Triangular Pencils with Integrated Eraser - HB - Box of 12","Qualitativ hochwertiges Produkt","simon","Bewertet werden die „BIC Evolution Triangle HB Dreikant Bleistifte mit Radiergummi - 12er Pack“.Verarbeitung & Benutzung--------------------------------------------------Die Firma BIC hat einen ergonomischen Bleistift entwickelt, der gut in der Hand liegt. Das gewählte Material vom Bleistift ist extrem robust. Dabei lässt sich die Mine dennoch leicht anspitzen.Der Bleistift hat den Härtegrad HB, eine Mindeststärke von 4,3 mm und ist vollständig ohne Holz versehen. Interessant finde ich, dass der Hersteller angibt, dass der ganze Bleistift kaubeständig ist. Ich kenne das aus meiner Schulzeit noch, dass ich das gerne gemacht habe, aber den Holzgeschmack nicht mochte.Fazit--------------------------------------------------Einen so robusten Bleistift hatte ich bisher noch nicht in der Hand. Zum Testen habe ich einen der 12 Bleistifte in der Mitte zerbrochen. Der Hersteller gibt an, dass durch das holzfreie Material das Produkt nicht splittert. Bei meinem Test konnte ich die Behauptung des Herstellers bestätigen. Eine klare Kaufempfehlung meinerseits.Wenn der Beitrag euch gefallen hat, würde ich mich über ein „nützlich“ freuen.","Reviewed in Germany on 20 November 2019","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"666","Bic - Evolution Triangle - Triangular Pencils with Integrated Eraser - HB - Box of 12","Im Grunde toll","Andreas","Die BIC Dreikant Bleistifte ""Evolution"" stellen erst auf den zweiten Blick eine neue Generation von Bleistiften dar.Das, was wie Holz aussieht, ist gar kein Holz, sondern Kunstharz.Den Unterschied spürt man weder beim Gebrauch, noch beim Spitzen, denn das ist alles wie gehabt.Die HB-Mine ist jedoch eine ganz normale Bleistiftmine von guter Qualität.Dass sie in der Kunstharzhülle besser geschützt ist, als in einer Holzhülle konnte ich bei normaler Verwendung nicht feststellen.Der Bleistiftköper ist mit blauem Metalliclack überzogen, sieht ganz schick aus.Am hinteren Ende befindet sich ein klassischer Aufsatz-Radiergummi in weiß. Wunder darf man von diesen Radiergummis nicht erwarten. Bei intensivem Gebrauch sind sie schnell aufgebraucht und nur noch die scharfkantige Blechhülle ist übrig und bei nur gelegentlichem Gebrauch verschmutzen und verfetten die Radiergummis und fangen an zu schmieren. Ich persönlich verwende stets einen ganz konventionellen Bleistift-Radiergummi in der gewohnten Riegelform.Trotzdem nur 4 Sterne, da mich im Angebotstext etwas wirklich stört.Da steht, dass beim Kauen auf dem Bleistift nichts absplittern kann.Also bitte. Man soll nicht auf dem Bleistift kauen! Und wer sich das wirklich nicht verkneifen kann, der ist mit einem nicht lackierten Echtholzbleistift bestimmt besser dran.Auf Kunstharz herumkauen? Wirklich??Wie auch immer, insgesamt ein ordentlicher Bleistift der seine erwartete Funktion hervorragend ausführt.","Reviewed in Germany on 18 November 2019","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

She had one herself, but she wanted to take mine on a University trip which involved a lot of time out in the field. When she got back, she conveniently lost 'my' pencil and not her own (I had grounds to believe that it was actually her pencil she lost - which I was eventually proved right when she confessed to her crime).Anyway, the tension got so heated at one point that she bought me a new one right there on the spot. I should add that this argument went on for months. I simple wanted a confession. That's how much these mechanical pencils mean to us!With my second copy, we went the distance together. What makes these pencils so great is that they just have this perfect weight and feel. It genuinely feels like quality and it's rare to find all of the graphite broken inside. You can really hit the darker tones of the HB quite effortlessly while being just as able to be used lightly and for speed taking notes.I used my first copy back when I was at University. I had to do a lot of technical drawings of architecture or infrastructure and I can honestly say that it always allowed me to deliver the quality of drawing that I had in mind. My second copy was mostly used for a lot of note-taking and the occasional drawing.My new copy, as displayed in the photograph, is mostly unused for now. I only bought this particular ASIN because it came with the additional graphite. This is only a couple of quid more expensive than just buying the supplies individually - so I figured why not have a backup!In any case, I am prepared this time if my Sister plans on another heist...","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 September 2018","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

The pencil is not as dark as other HB pencils, which isn't really a problem for me as I use it for technical drawings rather than shading. After about a years use the silver painting on my pencil began to wear away, but that is the only difference between this one and my old one.My only problem with the product is the lead refill. The price of the product is great as the refill on its own is a good percentage of the price of the pen with the refill included. However the little tube the lead is in is not very secure. I left it in a small pencil case and after a few weeks the lid had fallen out and my refills had all been smashed to pieces. I was a little disappointed by this as I had been using cheap lead refills when doing sketches and using the staedtler lead sparingly, and as mentioned before the refills on their own are quite expensive, but worth it considering how many other wooden pencils I would have gone through had I not switched to mechanical.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 June 2017","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Me gustó tanto que he repetido la compra. He de decir que la anterior la cambié porque me cayó y la pisé sin querer. Anteriormente había utilizado de Rotring que aunque no es mala, no tiene la punta retráctil y finalmente la goma de agarre se acabó rompiendo poco a poco en pedacitos. También tuve una Faber-Caster de punta retráctil que es bastante similar a la Staedler.Ésta tiene un agarre firme y ergonómico, con goma suave en la punta. Al escribir, no resbala ni gira.En mi caso, tengo la mala costumbre de hacer demasiada fuerza al escribir por lo que las minas de 0,5 las devoro, teniendo que usar en una lapicera normal minas de 0,7 mm. Con ellas el trazo para escritura en mi opinión queda demasiado ancho y ensucia mucho el papel. Gracias a portaminas como esta y su punta retráctil, puedo utilizar minas de 0,5 porque ese movimiento de muelle que tiene en la punta absorbe la fuerza que hago de más.Otra cosa que debo decir es que, si tienes la técnica de girar la lapicera a la vez que vas escribiendo para ir afilando la mina, con este portaminas puedes hacerlo de forma cómoda gracias al agarre simétrico que tiene.Así que estoy encantado con ella y si estás buscando un portaminas de calidad a un buen precio, yo no me lo pensaría más, es la tuya.","Reviewed in Spain on 29 December 2021","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Feels premium to hold and write. Use staedtler leads for smooth writing. Although, the lead is loosely held at the tip while clicking. Due to its weight and steel tip, leads break quite often. A single click pushes the lead more than it is required and therefore the lead travel has to be adjusted manually.

It feels smooth when I draw, however, the only drawback I've personally experienced is that I have to turn the pencil every few minutes to the sharper edge of the pencil lead since the lead becomes dull and the each stroke I make looks thicker whenever I want to keep it light, clean and sharp.

Als Liebhaber der Marke Faber-Castell war ich gespannt darauf, diesen Druckbleistift auszuprobieren, und ich wurde nicht enttäuscht.Die Verarbeitungsqualität des Druckbleistifts ist erstklassig, wie von Faber-Castell gewohnt. Der Schaft in grün metallic verleiht dem Bleistift ein elegantes und ansprechendes Aussehen, das in jeder Schreibumgebung gut aussieht. Die robuste Bauweise gewährleistet eine lange Lebensdauer, sodass dieser Druckbleistift ein treuer Begleiter für viele Schreibprojekte sein wird.Was den GRIP PLUS jedoch wirklich auszeichnet, ist sein ergonomisches Design. Der gummierte Griff liegt angenehm in der Hand und sorgt für ein komfortables Schreibgefühl, auch bei längeren Schreibsessions. Das bedeutet weniger Ermüdung und eine verbesserte Schreibpräzision.Die mitgelieferten 12 Minen mit einem Härtegrad von B und einer Minenstärke von 0,7 mm sorgen für ein reibungsloses Schreiberlebnis mit klaren Linien und dunklen Abdrücken. Die Nachfüllung der Minen ist einfach und bequem, sodass man sich keine Gedanken über Unterbrechungen beim Schreiben machen muss.Insgesamt kann ich den Faber-Castell Druckbleistift GRIP PLUS uneingeschränkt empfehlen.

"856","Faber-Castell Grip Plus Set 130997 Mechanical Pencil-Assorted Color","Por no más de 7-10 €, un portaminas de gama media-baja fiable, versátil, cómodo y elegante.","Alejandro","Por mecanismo interno, tengo desde hace años un primo de este, el Grip 2011 también en 0,7 mm.  Con tan buena opinión de este Grip Plus quería tenerlo y probarlo a buen precio.Lo que digo en el título lo cumple. Es un portaminas con buena prestancia pese a ser de plástico (hasta el clip), y se siente estupendamente en la mano. También tiene pinta metálica (como si fuera la de un bolígrafo) retráctil  y con amortiguación para proteger la mina de rotura (como todos los Grip).Pero es mejorable.No hay que pagar en exceso por él, pues es un portaminas muy de plástico, llegando incluso al mecanismo interno (el embrague y garras que sujetan y gestionan el avance de la mina son en plástico, no de latón).  Está fabricado en Japón, lo que es una garantía.Y por esto último es mejorable.  Este portaminas tiene varios primos-hermanos bajo diferentes marcas con leves diferencias estéticas.  Por lo que tengo entendido, el diseño base y general lo fabrica el grupo Kotobuki ('Kotobuki Group').  Varios de sus primos (de los que por las normas, no mencionaré marcas ni modelos) optan por ejemplo por un clip metálico, que creo que es más conveniente para este estilo de portaminas, y lo haría más duradero (no obstante el Grip 2011, o el más delgado y también de fabricación japonesa, Grip 1345, tienen clips metálicos).  Cuidad del de plástico, que son más propensos a romper.Viene envuelto en un par de bolsitas de plástico transparente, una de ellas hermética del tipo 'zip'.  Quizás algo escaso de protección. También viene cargado con 5 minas de la casa, creo que en dureza 2B.  Blandas, muy suaves, y bastante apropiadas para escribir con estos portaminas aprovechando el contar con la mina amortiguada ante excesos de presión contra el papel.Los colores son preciosos, por otros productos de la casa que comparten los de este modelo, lo sé.  No decepcionará ninguno, todos muy elegantes y aptos para toda ocasión y uso.  Y este rojo granate tampoco es la excepción, le queda espectacular.Pese a los puntos mejorables, no obstante, es bastante recomendable.  Es normal que tenga buena fama.  Así que si te hace tilín y está a buen precio o quieres darte el capricho, aprieta el gatillo.  No creo que te decepcione.","Reviewed in Spain on 15 November 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Lo uso para dibujo artístico, para escribir, para tomar apuntes..para cualquier cosa. Pensé que no me serviría para dibujar puesto que las misnas pone que son HB, pero son bastante blanditas y puedes hacer con ellas lo que quieras. Difícil de partir también.Al ser portaminas con goma, las gomitas son pequeñas, pero por unos 3€ en Amazon podéis compraros un recambio con 3 formas extra. Duran muchísimo así que merecen la pena. Borran fenomenal y es comodísimo escribir, y solo dando la vuelta al portaminas, borrar en segundos el fallo que hayas cometido. Porque borran realmente bien!Faber Castell nunca decepciona y el precio de este portaminas en concreto (comparados con otros de la misma marca o incluso de otras mucho peores en calidad...) es muy bueno!Si el otro día me compré uno del mismo tipo (por capricho) marca Milán en el bazar chino de mi casa y además de que ya se me ha roto la tapa de la goma (este modelo traía tapón para el borrador) las minas son durísimas, se parten a la mínima presión, la goma si borra bien, eso es cierto, y me costó 3€!! Éste me costó 6!No recomendaría otro, a no ser que lo queráis para dibujo técnico, que entonces hay otros más especificos....Ah! Parece que es gordito y va a ser incomodo al uso, pero para nada. Es ergonómico y se adapta perfectamente a la escritura/bibujo o para bocetos incluso.

El grosor 0.7 es ideal al ser algo mas resistente la mina y disponer una amortiguación por muelle, ambas características facilitan algo mas de presión para los subrayados y los trazos más nítidos en la escritura en diferencia de un grosor menor con 0.5. Si no te importa el detalle del color (te envían un color aleatorio, no se puede elegir) por el mismo coste de un solo portaminas, obtienes también un respuesto de goma y minas B. Lleva en su blister cerrado perfecto. A mi parecer es una genial opción de compra.

I happened to see these Faber-Castell pencils online and was intrigued by the photo.  I bought the blue, red, and blackberry with .7mm lead.  These pencils are definitely a step up in quality.  They are engineered with a superior ergonomic grip, a long twist-up eraser, and very stable tip.  The lead that came with them has just the right hardness and writes smoothly.  I like the larger diameter of the pencil, and the thin band of metal that is visible above the grip is a nice visual accent.  The colored barrels are plastic but the pencil has sufficient weight from the lower metal portion.","Reviewed in the United States on 26 September 2015","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"930","Faber-Castell Grip Plus Set 130997 Mechanical Pencil-Assorted Color","Perfekt für mich","Nina2401","Der Druckbleistift von Bic gefällt mir viel besser als die bisher benutzten normalen Bleistifte. Das ist zum einen das feine Schriftbild, das ich konstant erzeugen kann, in dem ich den Bleistift immer mal wieder drehe. Spitzen ist natürlich nicht erforderlich und wenn ich mich mal verschrieben habe, kann ich das blitzschnell mit dem integrierten Radiergummi korrigieren. Wenn man diesen vorsichtig herausdreht, finde man auch die beiden Ersatzminen.Durch einfaches Drücken wird die Mine weiter herausgeschoben und bleibt dann auch draußen. Zurück kann man sie nicht drücken, wenn man zu oft gedrückt hat, bedeutet das eine weit herausstehende Mine, die man dann vorsichtig runterschreiben sollte. Deshalb finde ich die Stifte für unterwegs nicht so gut geeignet. An der Seite befindet sich ein Clip, damit kann ich den Stift sehr gut an meinem Block befestigen.Ich habe die Stifte in 2 verschiedenen Minenstärken ausprobiert, kann da jetzt aber keine gravierenden Unterschiede feststellen. In beiden Stärken kann ich sehr fein schreiben.Ich werde die Stifte definitiv nachkaufen, aber das wird noch lange dauern, denn selbst ein Vielschreiber wie ich wird ewig mit den Stiften auskommen.","Reviewed in Germany on 24 May 2018","5.0 out of 5 stars",NA

Die einfahrbare Spitze ist nicht nur praktisch, sondern verleiht dem Stift auch eine zusätzliche Eleganz. Die Präzision beim Schreiben ist beeindruckend, und die 0,7 mm Mine ermöglicht ein sauberes und genaues Schriftbild.Die Haptik des rOtring 800 ist erstklassig. Das Gewicht des Stifts liegt angenehm in der Hand, und die Griffigkeit ist perfekt. Man spürt sofort, dass hier hochwertige Materialien verwendet wurden, was dem Stift eine robuste und langlebige Qualität verleiht.Obwohl der Preis dieses Druckbleistifts etwas höher ist, ist er meiner Meinung nach jeden Cent wert. Die Qualität und das Design rechtfertigen den Preis voll und ganz. Der rOtring 800 ist nicht nur ein Schreibgerät, sondern auch ein Hingucker auf meinem Schreibtisch. Die schwarze Farbe verleiht ihm eine zeitlose Eleganz.Insgesamt bin ich äußerst zufrieden mit meinem Kauf und kann den rOtring 800 Druckbleistift allen empfehlen, die nach einem hochwertigen und präzisen Schreibinstrument suchen – vorausgesetzt, der Preis spielt keine allzu große Rolle.Unter anderen kann ich auch die Kugelschreiberversion dergleichen Linie ,dem ich auch in Besitz habe genauso bedenkenlos empfehlen.","Reviewed in Germany on 6 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"954","Faber-Castell Grip Plus Set 130997 Mechanical Pencil-Assorted Color","Es calidad","Nick McPherson","Ho utilizzato la matita in questione (rotring 800 mina 0,7) per un paio di settimane al lavoro tutto il giorno come unico strumento di scrittura e disegno (oltre che a casa per diletto o per prendere qualche appunto a caso) e quindi mi sento pronto a dare un mio parere. Sono un impiegato tecnico (ingegnere civile) in uno studio di ingegneria, quindi per una cosa o per l'altra in studio scrivo o faccio qualche schizzo prettamente a matita, per abitudine soprattutto, ma è per dire che ho modo di usarla molto la matita. L'oggetto in questione è costruito in modo impeccabile, veramente bella ed elegante e trasmette veramente solidità, più di quanto mi aspettassi. Il meccanismo di estrazione della punta funziona bene, l'estrazione della mina per esigenze costruttive non è la più appagante che abbia mai provato (ma va benissimo) e il tutto funzione senza incertezze. La cosa che più mi spaventava era il peso, perchè gia in passato passando dal classico porta mine economico di plastica a questi in metallo il limite che alla fine mi aveva fatto tornare ai primi è il peso, che con un uso intenso dopo un pò stanza veramente. In questo caso, seppur la matita non sia sicuramente leggera, anzi, il fatto che si riesca a impugnare molto vicino alla punta fa si che non si percepisca molto il suo peso in mano e quindi devo dire che alla fine non mi stanca particolarmente nella scrittura (nel disegno di solito si avverte meno la cosa per il movimento più lento). Riguardo al presunto problema del puntale che traballa nella sua sede essendo estraibile devo dire che durante l'utilizzo veramente bisogna impegnarsi sul serio per riuscire a percepire qualcosa, per me non sussiste proprio come impedimento, anche se sicuramente rispetto alla sua sorella inore con punta fissa o a una qualsiasi altra matita meccanica senza punta estraibile se si va a giocare col dito sulla punta non trasmette la stessa fermezza dell'elemento. In conclusione devo dire che sono soddisfatto della matita, sono contento di essermi levato questo sfizio, perchè di sfizio si tratta, dato che il prezzo è sicuramente elevato se pensiamo che è una matita meccanica e non è che rispetto a quelle da 5 euro vadda chissà quanto meglio, si scrive pressoché uguale, l'unica differenza è la piacevole sensazione che ragala come strumento più esclusivo e di estetica e dato che la amtita la uso tutto il giorno volevo togliermi lo sfizio di averne una che mi piacesse tanto.","Reviewed in Italy on 28 July 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Personally, this is a pro and makes it feel like a quality product.ConsYou may as well assume that this thing doesn’t come with an eraser, just a lead stopper.If you get a ding on the pencil, the paint will be removed and exposed the raw metal beneath (eye sore for perfectionists).Due to the heavy weight, this pencil is difficult to write quickly with or do pencil tricks with.","Reviewed in the United States on 1 November 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"
"957","Faber-Castell Grip Plus Set 130997 Mechanical Pencil-Assorted Color","Premium pencil!!!","Amazon Customer","The rOring 800 is awesome. The negative reviews that say there is some tip wobble are way over blown on this aspect. There is a very little bit of wobble as there has to be in a moving part. This is consistent as I have several of these for my work. They all have the same amount of tip wobble.  Those reviewers who have such an issue with this aspect never actually discuss how the pencil performs tip wobble or not. In practice the minuscule tip wobble is simply not an issue. It is an outstanding pencil. I am an artist and use it all the time as well as the rOtring 600 and Graphgear 1000. These all have their strengths and purpose as do other pencils...even the wooden ones. The 800 is a wonderful tool and built extremely well and the retractable tip works as it should and makes this a travel friendly alternative to the 600.

"961","Faber-Castell Grip Plus Set 130997 Mechanical Pencil-Assorted Color","The tip wobble really isn't that bad","Mr Andrew M Parker","No doubt if you are looking into a 45 quid pencil you'll be doing your research. And some of that will lead you to a lot of people saying that the retractable Rotring has a slight tip wobble (because it's moving parts). I've been using this daily for  over a year now and it's still going strong. I'm a massive fidgetter so I'm constantly popping the nib in and out and taking the rubber protector on and off and it's still not gotten to a point where it's worn or damaged. This is my favourite pencil. It weighs a really nice amount for me and feels like a good bit of kit.The improvements I think it could do with are minor. The first is the little tab thing that you slide it onto shirt pockets and what not. I think this should not be painted. This area is the one that gets the most wear and naturally the paint chips. It'd made more sense to plain finish it. The second is the availability of the rubbers. The rubbers last ages but they are a little difficult to pickup, in the end I opted to go for the ones direct from their site because they are a special size and didn't want to get the wrong ones.Besides that though I really like the pencil. I'd definitely recommend it if you are looking to upgrade to a something proper.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 March 2019","4.5 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Do I need to say anything else?As an engineer myself, I've always preferred mechanical pencils to take notes, sketch & ""do math"" on.Habit I developed since before university. My last mechanical pencil was a Blue Pentel 0.7mm that I first purchased before getting into Uni and used it throughout all my Uni study & exams.I unfortunately lost that pencil while moving homes and needed to purchase my next ""companion"" for the future and possibly the ""last"" one I'll ever purchase.I had heard about rOtring Mechanical pencils and decided to purchase one as a gift to myself & as the tool it is. I have no complains about this pencil, I do not have complaints about the retractable tip being ""flimsy"" at all.. I use this for taking notes and ""doing math"" and sometimes sketches. I absolutely love the way the pencil feels in my hand while I write.Build quality is great and the pencil feels like a proper writing tool and not like a toy as some of these other mechanical pencils. It is a sturdy, well designed tool.The only ""complain"" I have, which I have will all pens/ mechanical pencils is due to the fact I have large hands, the ""clip"" is something I remove from all my pens/ mech pencils if they get in the way of my grip/ where the ""clip"" typically would rest on the hand.

Also looking at the photos I thought the gold accents looked cheap. In person this pencil looks anything but cheap. The gold, black and red is truly nice together. The Rotring 800 looks like a quality instrument. When you pick it up and start to write it’s even better. The mechanism that extends the sleeve has a satisfied spring. The pencil is well balanced and nicely weighted. One of the main concerns people have with the 800 is the sleeve. There is a little bit of movement. This is true but not enough for me to complain. I work in the interior design industry and hand draw floor plans for carpets, rugs and furniture. I also take notes and write quotes with the Rotring. That little bit of movement has not affected my experience with the pencil. I need to be able to carry the pencil in my shirt pocket or planner as well.

Unfortunately the amount of play in the tip is so great that it simply can't be ignored. I read a ton of reviews , watched loads of videos and bought this thinking that it can't be as bad as people made out in certain reviews but it unfortunately is.There is absolutely no reason why a pencil that clearly has top end machining and solidity elsewhere in the body has such an unacceptable amount of play in the KEY part of the pencil. To be clear, the part that extends and retracts has visible and very noticeable radial play between it and the section it slides up and down in to the point that it audibly clacks when you're writing with it. It should be approaching an interference fit and be absolutely solid as a fixed tip for something that costs as much as it does.It's current lax production format may be fine for casual writers and people coming to it green with few expectations or less demanding technical/precision needs but when you compare it to its fixed tip sibling, the 600, or the literal solid and precise, bones of your hand extension that the Pentel P205 is and writes like (still in my humble opinion the greatest mechanical pencil on the planet today), the difference is night and day.Can't recommend this at all and if you're thinking about it, I'd say buy the 600 in the tip diameter you want without any worries and buy yourself another four P205s with the money saved and fit a variety of different hardness leads in them for fun and variety. You'll be infinitely happier and better equipped in day to day pencil options.Sorry Rotring. For this to be your flagship pencil, you really should be doing better. Either sort your sliding mechanism tolerances out or add a sexy screw on cap to the 600, charge a fiver more for it and dump the 800.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 September 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

(on certain angles it is not)The push button on 800 is hard and also jiggly due to having a little extra room for lead sleeve parts.I like the 600's material better.The lead sleeve of 600 always is out and sharp and fragile.So, if you do not drop your pencil a lot (and break the sleeve lead of 600) and if you have a pencil casethen 600 is good.","Reviewed in the United States on 3 April 2019","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"997","Faber-Castell Grip Plus Set 130997 Mechanical Pencil-Assorted Color","Pencil has serious quality issues","Steven Black","I love Rotring pencils.  In general they are essentially the best drafting pencils around, both the Rotring Rapid Pro and the Rotring 600 are simply superb.  Having said all this it pains me to have to leave a negative review on the Rotring 800, but what can I say?  It is simply a bad product that is ridiculously overpriced.  Rotring touts the 800 as their cream of the crop mechanical pencil and it has a nifty twist mechanism, which pops in and out and makes the pencil pocket friendly by removing the sharp point.  And yes this twist mechanism does work; however, when you try to write with the pencil you will notice a lot of play in the metal tip.  Folks a mechanical drafting pencil is suppose to be precise.  Having a loose tip defeats the whole purpose of precise writing.  The pencil does look quite attractive, however; that is why it gets two stars.  Otherwise it is complete garbage.  If you want a high quality drafting pencil then buy either the Rotring Rapid Pro or the Rotring 600.  If you want a pocket safe pencil then get the Rapid Pro.  If you are not worried about the sharp point then buy the legendary Rotring 600.","Reviewed in the United States on 9 May 2015","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1000","Faber-Castell Grip Plus Set 130997 Mechanical Pencil-Assorted Color","Disappointing after the 600","K701","Like many others, it chomps lead in 2cm pieces- constant frustrating breaking. The only way to lessen this is to use harder lead (which I don't like) and not retract the nib (which was the whole point in buying it)- but still it happens occasionally. The mechanism seems to pinch the lead too hard unlike the 600. The broken pieces are always the same length. I have a massive collection of them. I went back to the 600 and it felt like the leads were lasting forever. The 800 is poor effort for the huge price. (I cannot sing the praises of the 600 enough though- beautiful in every way- except to transport with fragile pointy nib; I wish they would just have a lid!)","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 May 2016","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Non conoscevo inizialmente questo marchio, però informandomi e provandole personalmente mi sono accorto di quanto siano di qualità. Non solo vengono consigliati a chi studia nelle accademie di belle arti, ma hanno una qualità costruttiva eccezionale. La linea Academy permette di creare sfumature di vario genere, senza rovinare troppo il foglio. Il tratto non è troppo pesante e non necessita di grande pressione per poterci disegnare. La matita in se è di ottima qualità. Non appena riceverete la confezione a casa, vi troverete davanti ad una scatola di metallo molto comoda e resistente, con all'interno un set di colori da 24, ideali per dei disegni con non troppe sfumature. Se volete semplicemente disegnare su carta, vi consiglio di acquistare queste per il prezzo più basso, altrimenti puntate su altre linee sempre della Derwent.","Reviewed in Spain on 6 April 2022","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I  typically  will shy away from expensive  professional  artist  brands of media.  For that reason  Rose Art and Crayola were my go to brands  for non-water color pencils. That was until trying  the Faber-Castell  set of 12 Metallic  pencils and being  very impressed with  them.  I returned  to  purchase this box of 48 classic  color  pencils.  Just  like the  metallics I found them to be the best color pencils  I have  used to date.At that time  I compared  them to  eye brow  pencils for their almost  creamy textures.  Where you don't  need to  apply very much  pressure to apply the colors  onto various  types  of  paper.  The  leads don't  drag or break off . Nor does the color rub off your art work onto your hands or other surfaces.  My experience  has been that this is true  of this box of 48, which does include 2 of the metallic  colors  Gold and silver.  The colors are  richer and more vibrant  then Rose Art pencils which I  thought  were very vibrant  at the time I first purchased  them a few years ago.The  only  difference  that I  feel is worth mentioning  is that , included  in this box is a small pencil sharpener  for the  semi - hexagon  shaped  barrels Faber-Castell  pencils are known for.  It does  work  well in my experience . Without the  fusteration of broken leads that come with sharpeners that look similar to the  one included.These pencils  blend together  as well as my set of Royal-Langnickel water colors  do.  I  especially  like how  easily  I've been able to  use my Faber-Castell sets along with  my Bic  permanent  markers  and fineliners,  or  my Super Doodle and Lolliz gel pensBased on  this experience  I would  highly  recommend these pencils to colorists of all ages.","Reviewed in Italy on 21 March 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

This is a huge increase in terms of the choice of colours, which is a luxury, and at the same time, new experience. Please note, I have only tried those colours in blue. Here are my thoughts: (1) some of the colours blend in very well with each other, even up to four colours of blue blend in with each other as if it is natural.(2) not every colour blend, some stand up as it's own and can never be blended with others. I assume these are best for the ""light"" as shown in the pictures. It stands alone, so you don't need to worry these colours will get ""intruded"" by others.(3) there are some -to my surprise - has some shinny powder incorporated into the colour, the idea behind is really nice, as they are supposed to ""reflect and shine"" on the paper. However, pressure on these colours will actually reveal a dark-greyish colour instead of luxury reflective colour. Do note that I am still getting a hold on these colours, my impression on these new shine powder incorporated into colour pencils might change over time.Overall I am satisfied, and please note: never let the colour pencils fall from the table, the colour breaks instantly.Updates:Drew the last picture, and I am actually quite satisfied with the performance of the color pencil. Those few pencil with shiny powder incorporated can never be used to blend with other colors, but it has its own specialty and perhaps I might able to use them one day in some special things.","Reviewed in Australia on 29 January 2024","4.7 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Die Stiftenden sind gerade abgeschnitten und unlackiert.Die Minen zerbrechen kaum und lassen sich sehr gut anspitzen. Ein Übereinanderlegen von mehreren Farbschichten ist ebenfalls gut möglich. Radieren lassen sie sich gut mit einem weichen weißen oder transparenten Radierer.Von der Farbzusammenstellung her sind es kräftige Farben, die sich vor allem für den Schulunterricht eignen dürften. Gedeckte Farbtöne hingegen zum Zeichnen von naturalistischen Landschaften, Pflanzen, Tieren, Portraits etc. fehlen bis auf gedecktes Olivgrün. Ansonsten sind alle Farben klar, kräftig und leuchtend. Es gibt keine doppelten Farbtöne. Dazu kommen 5 Metallic-Stifte in Violett, Mittelblau, Blaugrün, Gold und Silber, die einen ganz dezenten Schimmer haben.Farbzusammenstellung: wenige Gelb- und Orangetöne, sehr viele Rot- und Pinktöne, eine gute Auswahl an Blautönen, eine auf den ersten Blick etwas unharmonische Auswahl an Grüntönen, eine gute Auswahl an Brauntönen und zwei Grautöne. Dazu Weiß und Schwarz. Das Weiß kann man zum Malen auf dunklem Papier verwenden, zum Setzen von Glanzlichtern auf anderen Farben eignet es sich nicht, da es nicht stark genug pigmentiert ist. Wenn man die Grüntone nach Farbnuancen (gelblich, bläulich, bräunlich) und nach Helligkeitsstufen ordnet, ergibt die Auswahl Sinn.Die Minen sind von der Härte her alle gleichermaßen weich bis auf ein helles Gelbgrün und Ocker. Diese beiden Stifte sind in meiner Packung schwächer pigmentiert und deutlich härter.Die leichte Kartonage ist wahrscheinlich nur zum Verkauf und Versand gedacht, nicht zur dauerhaften Aufbewahrung. Der Aufsteller aus dünnem Karton ist standhaft und geschmackvoll.Einzelstifte kann man nicht nachkaufen. Eine Farbkarte des Herstellers gibt es auch nicht.Merkwürdig ist, dass Faber-Castell in denselben roten Verpackungen, gleichgültig ob Kartonage oder Metallkasten, zwei verschiedene Qualitäten vermarktet: Neben der oben beschriebenen eher weichen Qualität auch noch eine weitere, die eher härtere Minen besitzt, keine Farbnummern und kein Namensfeld hat und auch etwas dünner lackiert ist. Wenn man eine Packung kauft, weiß man nicht, welche Qualität man bekommt.Fazit: sehr gute Stifte für Kinder und Jugendliche zu einem hervorragenden Preis, ansprechend aufzubewahren im  Karton-Aussteller. Die  Farbauswahl sollte vom Hersteller einmal etwas überarbeitet werden, dann können sie auch von Erwachsenen gut benutzt werden (weniger Rot- und Pinktöne, mehr Gelb- und Orangefarben, ein Creme-Farbton und ein stark pigmentiertes Weiß). Ein Nachkauf von Einzelstiften anhand der Farbnummern auf der Webseite des Herstellers wäre wünschenswert, ebenso eine ausdruckbare Farbkarte. Des Weiteren sollte sich der Hersteller einmal für EINE Qualität, vorzugsweise für die weichere, entscheiden.","Reviewed in France on 18 July 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I got a message from the DHL that they dropped it in the postbox! I stayed home the whole day because i was expecting it.","Like that they have a hard sharp point for detail. They sharpen well. No breakages so far which is a big plus! So many nice colours. I'd like names so figuring navy, black etc and some of the reds, greys would be easier. But as a budget pencil I guess can't be too fussy? Like that the whole barrell shows the colour even if it isn't exact. I have other pencils with coloured ends and the are so hard to find in my tray. Pleased to have a selection of greys. I should make the effort to learn their numbers maybe to save time? You can't put many layers sadly but with so many colours and how they an affordable set it's not such a big deal. Blending requires a soft touch. Not so easy as softer pencils. Because they are a harder pencil, beware wreaking the surface of your paper esp when you have that nice sharp point. It's made me realise I probably don't need a huge fancy set of over a hundred colours as the more you have the more confusing it gets choosing and finding colours. I was feeling limited using 12 and 24 colour sets and this budget friendly set was a chance to experience more choice. Main point is if you learn how to work with them and you can create some nice pictures. I like softer pencils more but appreciate the lack of constant shapening and breakage I was getting with my other set. And how detail is so much easier.","Reviewed in Germany on 22 December 2020","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1120","Derwent Graphic Soft Graphite Drawing Pencils, Ideal For Illustrating & Shading, Set Of 12, Professional Quality, 34215","Derwents are some of the best around","Mz Nina, business consultant and aspiring artist","I looove this brand, also all their colored pencil lines.  I know everyone is Prismacolor crazy, but it is hype.  Derwents are just as good and I am a little partial to them simply they are the ones I learn to draw with even as a kid.  I remember my first Derwent kit that Dad bought me, 120 pencils and I was around 8 and we were livi9ng in Australia.I love the water color pencils, the graphite, the ink tense that you can actually draw on fabric with and it stays, and the color soft line.  I also have a few others, but those are my favorites.I would say there pencils are as good as any other including Prismacolor.Just make sure to get the right pencil sharpener no matter what you use.  Get a Derwent battery operated, which is still made or a Panasonic or a used HUNT-Boston, all of which are no longer made.  DO NOT GET X-ACTO, it chews your pencils up and constantly breaks the lead.INFO ON ELECTRIC PENCIL SHARPENERS:I am a color pencil artist, and you need to have either a Panasonic, ""Hunt-Boston"" pencil sharpener, otherwise your colored pencils are eaten.  NEVER BUY X-ACTO for colored pencils, X-ACTO will eat your pencils.  Until you can find a Panasonic or Hunt-Boston, or Hunt or Boston electric pencil sharpener, get this if you can find one, or the Derwent ""BLACK"" model as it had 2 holes, one for a longer tip and one for a shorter tip.  I have both.  I had bought the Derwent one as I have Derwent but also use Prismacolor and graphite.  Panasonic and Hunt Boston are NO LONGER MADE no matter WHAT anyone says.  I was lucky to buy a new PANASONIC electric pencil sharpener by trolling the net until I found on.  Bought a used Boston, model #18, used on eBay and paid waaaay too much.  It was pretty beaten up.Also, if you do buy used, get one in the best quality that you can and just pay the extra, I would say up to $35.  I personally would not spend more than that.  I paid $38 for my new Panasonic.Also, X-ACTO bought out ""Hunt-Boston"" and all new models are a 4 digit model number, the actual ""Hunt-Boston"" is only a 2 digit.  This issue is that X-ACTO still sells under the Hunt Boston name, and it is misleading as it now uses X-ACTO cutters, which do NOTHING but EAT your pencils.  I also do not like it when someone lies about what they are selling.I bought what I thought was a ""HUNT"" electric pencil sharpener, it came in a box that had the Hunt name and packaging, but when I opened it up it was a, you guessed right...  An X-ACTO!!  Said so right on the sharpener.Bought on line here at Amazon from Overstock.com, but I returned it and got a refund, including shipping as they were misleading.Hope this helps with those of you who are colored pencil artist.  Get a PANASONIC, HUNT-BOSTON or Derwent sharpener.Also, run a graphite pencil through your sharpener first thing every day and it will stay sharp longer since colored pencils are waxy and tend to build up on the cutters.","Reviewed in the United States on 18 February 2013","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Martinez","So I did swatches of all the pencils I received (bought 12 hard and 12 soft sets) and was surprised at how dark 9h looked. I then start a swatch with 8h and it was much lighter. I thought maybe I just pressed lighter on the 8h, I continued with the rest of the pencils, and everything was perfect. So I did more comparisons of 8h and 9h with drawing lines, different shading, etc, and 9h is definitely darker than 8h, but whatever, I at least now know what to expect from both those pencils, probably just a lull in quality assurance that day. So a star off for that, butt other than that, great pencils, will buy again for their great price and (hopefully more reliable) quality.","Reviewed in the United States on 17 December 2015","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

This is the first tin I have gotten that has a damaged pencil in see photo it doesn’t look like it ruined the core of the pencil thankfully. For some of the reviews that mention only getting them in a tin without a lid and just the bottom shrink wrapped(the only difference is the lid not being there it’s still only the bottom shrink wrapped even if you get a lid not sure why they do that.)

I've had my teacher tell several other students that their supplies weren't adequate but has always just focused on showing me how to use mine. I don't know too much about pencils but if you're looking for a great starter range I would recommend this set.The only down side I have for the pencils is that the case doesn't allow for easy viewing and the pencils fall out fairly easily. However, I didn't really consider the case a huge deal because it stores them perfectly in transit. I just think it would be nice if the pencils snapped in and had a label along the bottom (not on the pencil) to know which pencil you're grabbing (because the pencils will rotate in the case).","Reviewed in the United States on 4 November 2013","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I also live in Canada, so that might be different for others. The graphite is pretty resistant to breaking, lays down graphite smoothly, and is pretty dark. It's not the darkest or smoothest I've drawn with, but it is super affordable. The overall quality of the pencils are still very good, artist quality. They're great for quick sketches, but excel in detailed sketches.","Reviewed in Canada on 29 July 2019","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Lofthouse","Ces crayons Woody nous ont été conseillés par la maîtresse de notre petite dernière en CE1, car ils sont effectivement utilisables sur les ardoises Veleda et contrairement aux feutres, ils ne s'usent pas (en tout cas beaucoup moins vite) ! Les ardoises Veleda sont utilisées quotidiennement ici et c'est vrai que les feutres qui vont avec ont une fâcheuse tendance à ... défiler ! Du coup on a testé. Ces craies grasses tiennent très bien sur l'ardoise, sans forcer les couleurs sont nettes, vives. Après un petit coup d'éponge humide, c'est effacé. Comme ils ont une mine ça va très bien pour écrire. Ils sont bien assez gros pour ne pas se casser (on a eu peur que des chutes leurs soient fatales comme avec des crayons de couleur mais il est mentionné ""incassable"" sur la pochette, vu l'épaisseur et la texture, c'est bien possible). Et en plus un taille crayon est fourni quand la mine s'use (ça heureusement parce que vu la taille des crayons, le format est très particulier ;)).Le prix est un peu élevé mais je suis contente de les avoir eu en promo (13€ environ pour 10) et quand on fait le calcul avec leur durée de vie potentielle, tout est relatif...En photo, un dessin sur ardoise ... oui étant donné toutes les jolies couleurs ma fille n'a pu s'empêcher de dessiner au lieu d'écrire :)","Reviewed in France on 14 January 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1212","Multi-Talented Pencil - STABILO woody 3 in 1 - Pack of 10 - Assorted Colours with Sharpener","Fantastic - strong colour like felt tip but writes like crayon","debbie8355","These are much chunkier than any toddler mark making tools I've used before but are easy to hold and use with their non slip grip wood pencil like outer. They are round rather than the often found triangular grip but this means you can sharpen them with the oversized sharpener included.I did balk at the cost of this set but I think these crayons that look like pencils and are as strong a colour as felt tips are worth it. The drawing you can do with them is strong and colourful - much brighter than colouring pencils and you can even draw on glass and plastic with the mess easily removed with something like a baby wipe. Like crayon though it doesn't mark fabric well so greater protection for things like your carpet and sofa. I have tried scribbling on my brown fabric sofa and the brighter colours like red did make a line but it only took a baby wipe to remove compared to lots of scrubbing needed with crayola washable markers.You get that soft flowing feel crayon feeling in use - like silk crayons rather than the scratchy normal pencil feel.I will buy these over normal pencils again for my toddlers. 4+ will probably prefer more grown up looking pencils as these definitely look like toddler ones.Update 25/10/16 still love these and I've gone on to purchase the pack of 18 which is even better as you get a black plastic storage tray plus a paintbrush and sharpener in fitted sections. Once over painted with water the colours do fade a lot to look like watercolour.

Die 3. Funktion ist  mit Wasser möglich. Die Farben müssen etwas dicker auf dem Blatt sein und dann kann mit Wasser dann ein Aquarellartiges Bild entstehen.Die Stifte sind super für Kinderhände geeignet, da mein Sohn (2) oft Sachen durch die gegend wirft, brechen die meisten Mienen. Das ist hier absolut nicht der Fall. Jetzt nach 1monat testen kann ich sagen, alle Stifte sind noch Heile :)Dadurch, dass hier ein Anspitzer bei war, lassen sich die Stifte prima wieder in die Ursprungsform bringen und die Kinder können wieder weiter malen.Hier jedoch das , warum ich einen Stern abgezogen habe: Vorsicht bei dem roten Stift an der FensterfrontDas Gummi am Fenster ist beim abwischen etwas rosa geworden und ich habe es noch nicht wegbekommen.

Sie gleiten sehr leicht übers Papier, im Gegensatz zu anderen Buntstiften, sodass man tolle Erfolge erzielt. Die Wasserlöslichkeit ist bei kleinen Kindern natürlich ein unschlagbarer Vorteil und man kann völlig entspannt bleiben, wenn mal was auf den Tisch daneben geht. 😉Was ich allerdings super ärgerlich finde: bei der jetzigen Nachbestellung war die Verpackung ziemlich ramponiert und wir dachten direkt, die Stifte wurden schon benutzt (waren aber unbenutzt). Normal würde mich das nicht stören, aber diese Packung war als Geburtstagsgeschenk gedacht und macht so absolut keinen tollen Eindruck (habe zwei Beispielbilder angefügt).

"1252","Royal & Langnickel sketching artist pencils - set of 12 drawing pencils 5H to 6B","Good for starters","Tanille Roesler","I'm really glad I made the investment for real artist pencils, having the different varieties of darkness has helped me a lot in the last couple months since I got them.  I don't do that full greyscale shading stuff, barely breaking ground into general shading, no way I can do that.  But it makes it a lot easier for my drawings because instead of how I did it before where I would just try to draw the basic shapes and general outline with pencil, usually mechanical, lightly and then as I went, each new ""layer"" would be slightly darker with the permanent stuff that I would trace over with pen as the darkest, but then when I inked the drawing, let the ink dry, and go back to erase before coloring, it was often very difficult to get rid of all the pencil lines because of how hard and dark I had to go with some of them.  But now with these artist pencils, I lightly do the basic shapes with the lightest pencil, and as I go up in ""layers"" I go one or two pencils up for a darker line with minimal effort amd barely any pressure.  The result is a group of line in varying degrees of darkness that can still be easily erased once I have inked the final outline and I don't have pesky persistent lines and pressure spots showing through my color.  PLUS because you are using multiple pencils per drawing, they last a lot longer before needing to be sharpened.  The one I used most, the 5H, lasted almost two full months before needing to be sharpened and I still haven't sharpened any of the others.  My only beef is a cpuple of them have one spot on the led where it's kind of scratchy and instead of gliding over the paper I can feel it catching.  These are a good set for a starter or someone who doesn't intend to do full greyscale art like me, I doubt I will ever need to move up to a larger or higher end set than this one.","Reviewed in the United States on 27 February 2020","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

The only problem is... they don’t have erasers! Now I know that many fancy drawing pencils don’t have erasers, I’ve used all kinds of great pencils that have erasers though. Not having an eraser on the end doesn’t make a pencil “not cool”. I don’t know how hard it is to put one on... hence the four stars, it’s missing an eraser. Sometimes a tiny eraser like that can be more precise than the erasers you can buy that fit in your hand. I guess you could get the little ones you stick on top, but maybe just buy a drawing pencil with an eraser built in.","Reviewed in the United States on 27 December 2017","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1286","Royal & Langnickel sketching artist pencils - set of 12 drawing pencils 5H to 6B","Not enough tone difference between the H's and the B's","Sacha","I had high hopes for this set of pencils, because it contained several pencils that I havent had in previous pencil sets - i think the darkest I've had was a 2B or 4B? And these went up to 6B - and I like how the B pencils get much softer and darker the farther down their scale you go. Unfortunately, though, there wasnt an extremely noticeable difference from the 6H all the way through to the 6B in this particular set of pencils. I need the softer darker pencils to be very blendable, and these just weren't. I made a chart where I colored a square using each pencil, in order, using the same amount of pressure in each one. There really wasnt a big difference. Then I tried to shade over the squares to see if the blended or smudged well, and you could still see all of the pencil hashmarks. On EVERY SINGLE ONE. I dont expect the H's to blend barely at all, but the hashmarks on all of the B's should have at least started to smudge. The way I draw consists mainly of shading and tone differences, ranging from really light to really dark pitch black.  I mostly use a stump to blend all of it together, and take turns alternating between my stump and my kneaded eraser to do the actual drawing, to bring out the highlights and deepen the shadows. These pencils just dont vary enough in the hardness for me. I'm going to keep them, though, because I just dont feel like going through the trouble to send them back just to get my five bucks back. I can always write letters with them, right?","Reviewed in the United States on 9 February 2020","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I remember I used to like 2B pencils, but I thought I'd grab a mixed pack and try to gauge how they all lay down. The quality seems great for the cost, they're pre-sharpened. The shaft seems to be natural wood so there's some variations in colour of the wood, which adds a little interest more than anything else. The graphite is transfers nicely and isn't too brittle. I quite liked the 2H the 2b and 5b in particular.The only downside is that I find the plastic packaging sleeve bloody awful. It's too fiddly to keep the pencils in to keep them in good condition as the short top flap is very sharp and stiff and tries to dig into the leads as you slide the pencils back in. Can't even seem to get the plastic to accept a fold back in the other direction to get it to stay open.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 October 2018","3.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

They lay down very nicely and blend quite easily. The pencils that have the colour names along the shaft, do have the colour at the base; however, do completely swatch to gain the true hues. The set includes an excellent white - perfect for blending and softening, plus a very good black. The pencils sharpen smoothly without any breakages or splits and are comfortable to hold. Of course, one could always want more colours, but with a little patient layering, a variety of skin tones are achievable. The colours are different to those in the 72 pencil watercolour set, but there are similar colours to be found there, as can be seen with the horizontal comparison bars on the swatch. All round, an excellent starter set before investing in the 72 set, plus a great bonus is that Derwent have a skin tone tutorial page.","Reviewed in Germany on 28 November 2020","3.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I found a water soluble transfer paper that is a life saver, but I still need to draw faces and hands with very fine lines. Once regular pencil lines are gone over with water, they are sealed and not erasable. Regular graphite water soluble pencils dissolve in water but leave gray washes, which I like for value studies. For my regular work,  these water soluble colored pencils for skin tones are the answer! I can transfer the major part of my image, then finely tune hands and faces, even on small works, and the lines will dissolve.","Reviewed in Germany on 15 January 2016","3.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Il tappo non è ad incastro, ma ruota scoprendo un foro nel contenitore da cui inserire o estrarre le mine. In questo modo è più difficile che la confezione si apra per sbaglio disperdendo le mine ovunque.PRODOTTOLe mine che utilizzo e recensisco sono le HB da 0.5mm, adoperate con un portamine Pentel Graph 1000 CS. Il tratto si presenta deciso e spesso, ma non eccessivamente. La mina è incredibilmente resistente alla rottura. Ho notato infatti che si rompe meno frequentemente (praticamente mai) rispetto alle mine prodotte da altri marchi, anche molto famosi.Altro valore aggiunto, almeno per me che sono mancino, è il fatto che il tratto che lascia è molto pulito, privo di frammenti di mina che potrebbero sporcare mano e foglio scrivendo.PREZZOIl prezzo è assolutamente concorrenziale con quello di altri marchi, specialmente se rapportato all'eccellente qualità di queste mine.","Reviewed in Italy on 1 February 2020","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Erschreckend eindeutig. Die Minen brechen viel schwerer als günstige Minen und sie fühlen sich insgesamt besser und stabiler an, als vergleichbare Minen anderer Marken. Der höhere Preis wird meiner Meinung nach eindeutig gerechtfertigt. Besonders für passgenaue Druckbleistifte, wie den Pentel Graphgear 1000 sind diese Minen nur zu empfehlen.","Reviewed in Germany on 6 September 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I normally use the Prismacolor Color Pencils and was looking to order another set, when I saw the Arteza Color Pencil sets. I went online and checked the reviews of the pencils. There were a lot of good reviews of the Arteza pencils, so I decided to try theme. The price for what I would be getting was very good. Over a 60% savings over the other name brand.Upon receiving and opening the set, I was very surprised at what I had received. It was a well packaged and organized sets of Color pencils. I brought out some of my other older and different brands of pencils for further review. After a series of tests, I can claim that these are on a level equivalent to the Prismacolor pencils. They sharpen and hold a good point and have a lesser series of lead breakage than the others being compared. They have a smooth feel when using and they blend very easily.In purchasing, reviewing and using the Arteza brand Color pencils. I feel that I have made a good choice. I have purchased and used several of their products and they all have presented me with great results. I hope that they continue with the quality and pricing of their products, and I look forward to getting more of the Arteza products for future use in my artworks.","Reviewed in Australia on 11 May 2023","4.7 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

These are really good for my needs, the 72 set has a huge variety of pencils. They’re very soft and pigmented, for the most part they layer well, but there comes a point when they don’t accept new layers and the surface can get very waxy. That’s the only downside, though for a beginner who wants a good quality set that isn’t too expensive, I think they’re great quality and value. The pencils keep a point very well so there’s no need to sharpen them frequently. They’re sturdy and don’t break easily.

"1456","ARTEZA Colouring Pencils, Professional Set of 72 Colours in a Tin Box, Soft Wax-Based Cores, for Drawing, Sketching & Shading","Great value for money; exceptional set! Definitely better than Prisma's","まくまく","Great customer service (when I had a fault, I contacted them and they resolved it without any dispute!) and really quick delivery (arrived next day!)...The pencils themselves are fantastic. In the past, I've had a set from WHSmith, Marco Raffine's and Prismacolours. This set far easily outstrips them all. The colour range (in the 72 set) is fantastic - couldn't ask for a better range, especially in the reds, pinks and purples that are lacking in some sets! The pencil core is slightly wider than what I've used previously, meaning you don't go through the pencil as quick. The quality of the wax is definitely better than either of the WHSmith or Marco Raffine sets. Prisma's are oil-based and finding these better than prisma's may be personal preference. I like to lay down a lot of colour when I'm colouring (I can be very heavy-handed), and this destroyed my soft-core prismas -- I just blazed through a very expensive set owing to how I colour. If you're like me, and lay a lot of colour down and like really sharp points, then these are a fantastic choice.When it comes to colouring, the blending and layering is equal to prismacolours and better than marco raffine. The wax in the marco raffine, I think, is slightly harder (and lays down a bit scratchy) which is more noticeable after you've used these.If, like me, you now find the market saturated with choices of pencils, pens and colouring book to satiate all colouring enthusiast appetites, you won't go wrong with this set. I did hesitate at first, owing to the cost and being not sure of the quality; however, you really won't be disappointed. The colours are bright, there's a brilliant range, they blend and layer really well, and are great value for your hard-earned income with excellent customer service: what more could you ask for from a set of pencils?","Reviewed in Japan on 1 June 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Los colores tienen nombre, es decir, a uno de los verdes lo llaman matcha o absenta, es muy original, y tienen grabados unas estrellitas que indican la resistencia del color a la exposición solar, para mi muy útil.Puedes sacar punta perfectamente, no como ocurre con otros ""de tan buena fama"" que hay veces que te desespera poder afilarlos mínimamente. (en fin lo de siempre, cria fama...)He alucionado al leer, los titulos de algunas valoraciones, diciendo que no los recomiendan por el tema de la cajita o las bandejas, en lugar de valorar el lápiz en sí, tema que a mi francamente me es indiferente, ya que siempre acabo guardando mis colores, en un estuche de tela enrollable, mucho más práctico para mi.La caja es de metal, con cierre de visagra y las bandejas son de plastico, normal.En definitiva, sí, son equiparables a los prisma, por no decir mejores, y en definitiva el precio es fantastico. No puedo opinar en relación a los caran d'ache, porque no los he utilizado. Con respecto a los Faber, éstos son base aceite, Arteza base cera, los noto diferentes por este motivo, por lo tanto no valoro, es cuestión de gustos.Lo que sí me fastidia un poco es que no puedas comprar los colores individualmente, pero...Sin duda, la próxima vez, compro la caja de 120.Que quede claro, que mi valoración (por los años que llevo pintando y dibujando utilizando diferentes técnicas),  es sincera para ayudar a futuros compradores, al igual que yo obtuve ayuda al leer otros comentarios.

They layer beautiful , are soft core but can hold a fine point and they DON’T crumble ! Arteza colouring pencils are always highly pigmented , I owe also the old 72 count pencil set with smaller cores, this 120set goes a step further , 4mm cores !  You have every colour you will ever need in the beautiful Owl box , my only regret are those horribly flimsy plastic trays. There are 5 of them , colour swatches are on the bottom of the box and inside the hinged cover with names and numbers .  The pencil have on them self their name ,number  & COLOUR FASTNESS . The paint on the pencils is quite correct with the cores . The names ,I wonder who find them in the team ......KOALA GREY, COYOTE BROWN, MARMALADE ORANGE , FRUIT PUNCH , PEACHES AND CREAM  AND  NOW ONE OF MY FAVOURITES :  UNICORN PURPLE !!!  There is not one split pencil in the set.  I had a slight problem with my first set , the Customer care is second to none !  The next day was a brand new perfect set delivered !  I contacted the Arteza team by e-mail and in minutes they responded in minutes. Without any fuss or faff the wanted just my address ,where to send a new set .I owe also smaller sets of polychromos they are without a doubt good pencils , but not for me .  I  prefer how Artezas behave , and also price wise Polys are about £ 157 and Artesas £60 . Both are 120 count . I’m not an artist , but I like drawing and colouring . I was hesitating to buy the big Arteza set because I owe at least twelve big sets from all around the world , but my prefered pencils are Arteza , if possible I would give 10 stars to the pencils & 10 stars to the Arteza Customer Service !!!

Soy dibujante y me gustan probar cosas nuevas como lápices sobre todo. He oído sobre la marca Arteza diferentes opiniones y me decidí arriesgarme adquiriendo una lata de 72 lápices porque  costaba 0,51€ / unidad.La lata es muy bonita y compacta, parece ser durable. Los lápices están puestos en 3 pisos y sobre la tapa de la lata por dentro está la carta de los colores(72) puestos con sus números, el nombre en inglés y el rango de resistencia a la luz. En general son blandos, los colores son bonitos aunque haya según mi opinión muchas rosas y no son para aquellos a quienes gustan colores neutros.  Las minas son resistentes y pone que miden 4mm.  Para papel blanco están adecuados(hice mi carta de colores sobre papel color natural(sketchbook de la marca Hahnemühle con gramaje de 140g/m²). He podido hacer dos capas en general y no estoy muy satisfecho . Esta escrito que se pueden usar también  para el papel negro, por esto hice la prueba( 4ta foto) y me quedé decepcionado porque no sale como en la foto que ha puesto la marca(hice prueba sobre papel color negro de Talens(Black sketchbook de 140g/m²). Sobre todo los amarillos y rojos se ven fatal!  Así que no lo recomiendo(dibujar sobre papel negro). Además la mayoría de los colores de los lápices no coinciden con el color de su tinta(ejemplo fuerte el color Coral/A203/!). Te salvan los números en este caso.No me quedó claro la resistencia a la luz, ¿Cómo esta hecha? Y porque estos lápices son profesionales, tampoco.

Cela faisait longtemps que je les voulais, car j'ai une grande collection de crayons de couleur (Prisma, Polychromos, Guang Hui, Caran d'Ache, Giotto etc....) et j'avais eu de bons échos sur les réseaux sociaux en coloriage art thérapie, à un moment donné (très vite d'autres marques prennent le relais d'actualité).Perso, j'aime l'esthétique des crayons déjà (très beau) ils sont numérotés (bon pour ma part j'utilise pas de nuancier donc..) et alors l'odeur est  à tombé. Elle a une odeur de beurre de cacao, quelque chose de gourmand et d'assez fort (c'est très entêtant on aime ou pas perso j'adore, car je supporte pas les odeurs chimiques...). C'est une odeur proche des Prisma mais en plus fort je dirais, et perso, moi ça me transporte quand je colorie ;)J'ai commencé à colorier sur un colo, mais aussi testé sur feuille blanche, une sensation assez grasse glissante proche des Prisma dans la sensation de coloriage (je me permettrais pas de comparer sur la qualité, car les Prisma niveau pigmentation et qualité sont biensûrs au dessus), une sensation très confortable agréable, et plus facile je trouve que les crayons plus secs avec une pigmentation aussi bonne (après question de goût).J'ai trouvé quand même des traits communs aux Prisma plus que dans d'autres marques.Maintenant, là où je suis un peu déçu c'est le choix des couleurs (trop de vert notamment...) et avec quasi dans chaque tonalité de couleurs 2 couleurs quasi identiques  (pas décelable sur la couleur des crayons ne correspondant pas du tout à la réalité des couleurs une fois colorié ). C'est une marque intéressante et de bonne qualité bon rapport qualité prix (j'ai aussi les feutres que j'aime bien mais moins aussi pour le choix des couleurs...), même si vous trouverez encore mieux pour ce prix avec plus de crayons, pour ma part, ceux qui aiment le côté gras des Prisma mais que vous ne pouvez pas vous offrir dans l'immédiat, c'est intéressant, et ou pour compléter ces gammes de crayons.Nul part il est indiqué qu'ils sont à la cire mais pour ma part je pense que oui, car ils correspondent en tout point à la sensation de glisser et gras que l'on peut avoir avec et que j'aime tant.Une gamme à compléter pour des amoureux des crayons et ou très bien pour commencer...","Reviewed in the United States on 14 December 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

They colour amazing, the colours are very rich and they feel great using them. However, they sharpen horribly. Every time I'd sharpen them they would break, you have to be very careful and still they are fragile. I've been using these not even three months and already I have little stubby pencils. My other good pencil crayons lasted me years.

"1477","ARTEZA Colouring Pencils, Professional Set of 72 Colours in a Tin Box, Soft Wax-Based Cores, for Drawing, Sketching & Shading","Lovely wax-based coloured pencils","Ninou","These pencils are perfect for using in adult colouring books and for hobby artists. The pencil colours adhere to the paper well, they sharpen well, although they are quite soft so don't stay sharp for long. Very good range of colours that blend nicely; not quite as well as very high-end pencils such as Polychromos (oil based), but still very good.Like all wax-based coloured pencils, miniscule bits of the nib break off while colouring. To avoid these tiny bits smudging your work, avoid using your hand to sweep them away. A soft brush is better. Minor smudges are easily removed with an eraser - I use a Faber-Castell eraser pencil. I wouldn't recommend using an electric eraser on these Arteza pencils as in my experience it's more likely to smudge than erase. I imagine that's due to a combination of the wax pencil and the plasticy type of eraser my electric eraser uses.These pencils are the Arteza Expert range, which appears to be their top-level range. I also have a small set of the Arteza Premium range, which are also very nice to use. I don't notice much difference between the two ranges, apart from the barrel shape: round (expert) versus triangular (premium).I think the normal price, which is in the low-£40 region, is very good value for the number and quality of the pencils in this set. I was lucky enough to buy on a Black Friday deal, so it was even better value.The Arteza customer services is really helpful and polite. I contacted them with a query and they replied within a few hours, and sent a replacement for a faulty pencil the following day. Best customer service I've ever had from a company on Amazon.","Reviewed in the Netherlands on 1 May 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Sometimes it pays off, and this is such a time. At the price, I was expecting something less than Marco or Colore quality. Instead, thus far the Arteza Expert is much like Prismacolor, specifically the Prismas I used to get back in the 1960s. Arteza has a little harder core and so requires a bit more aggressive touch. Both are wax-based, with both name and number on the barrel, but Arteza also indicates color-fastness, which is largely exceptional. The Prisma is maybe three-tenths of a millimeter larger diameter. Personally, I have not experienced the breakage problem with Prisma some people have, and am having none with these. They didn't seem to be very blendable at first, but some odorless thinner kicks them in the direction of oil painting. I tried intermixing with Prisma as a test and found it doable, if a bit tricky, yielding a look different from either. Overall, I am delighted with this find, enough so that I am going to order the 72 set as soon as I finish this review. I suspect they will get pricier when more people discover them.  Quick follow-up- The 72 set had a strong paint odor when I opened it, probably from being packaged immediately after the barrels were painted. The smell is fading fast once they are exposed to air to finish curing.","Reviewed in Australia on 11 May 2023","4.7 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

The 120 color pencil set is wonderful! The color selection is very good, which a balanced and rich selection. Thumbs up to purples and pinks. The cores are even softer than 72-color set. You don’t use almost any effort to draw.  I really  like to see names on pencils and the lightfastness, useful for professionals. Only three concerns: 1. I didn’t find if they’re oil or wax based, but they’re very very soft. 2. I miss fluorescent colors. They would  turn this set even more beautiful. There is an “fluorescent yellow “ pencil, but that’s not the case. It a lime yellow. 3. There are (for me) too much grays (14 shades, not including the two “blacks” and silver). I preferred less grays and more other colors, specially pastels. Indeed, the price is a bit expensive in my country (because of the import taxes).

È incredibile considerando che abito in un luogo sperduto della Puglia.I colored pencils Arteza, che dire, sono arrivati in condizioni eccellenti, la prima cosa che mi ha colpito dopo aver aperto la scatola di latta è stato l'odore di legno vero, legno fresco mescolato a quello dei pigmenti delle matite WOW!Il rapporto qualità prezzo è molto onesto, il fatto che estrarre ogni volta i colori dalle vaschette impilate le une sulle altre è un po' noiosetta come attività, ma non è un problema insuperabile.Ammetto che ero scettico durante l'acquisto, non conoscendoli mi sono fatto ingolosire dall'ottimo prezzo.Come si comportano questi colori sulla carta? Direi che mi hanno sorpreso, i colori sono a base cerosa, anche se ho il sospetto che ci sia una piccola quantità di base oleosa, perché non fa la patina tipica di questi colori (a meno che uno non lo voglia come effetto ci passa sopra un po' di bianco).Sfuma bene, si possono sovrapporre molti strati di colore se si usa una carta mediamente ruvida, io uso la Canson, e anche quando la carta è ormai saturata di colore se ne può aggiungere dell'altro! Ed è questo il punto a favore che mi ha fatto abbandonare ogni scetticismo.A scanso di equivoci, il bianco non copre i colori, se avete necessità di ottenere punti luce procuratevi dei bianchi speciali perché tanto è inutile sono poche le marche di colore che hanno il bianco che si impone sulle altre campiture.Per il resto i colori sono molto vividi, luminosi, adatti a stili pop ma sorprendono molto anche con il classicismo.Li consiglio per studenti e professionisti, sono un ottimo strumento, migliori di tante altre marche super blasonate.","Reviewed in Germany on 8 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

They arrived in pristine condition, safely nestled in their tin case within a cardboard sleeve and packed carefully in their shipping box.  I have many other brands of pencils in my collection, including Prismacolor Premiers and Faber Castell Polychromos and after testing these pencils, I can say they definitely hold their own against brands that cost a great deal more!  In appearance, they remind me a lot of Polychromos, with fully lacquered barrels in the colour of the lead and dipped ends.  The core is 4.5 mm thick so I expect these pencils will be quite durable.  Every pencil arrived in perfect condition, no cracked cores, no nicks or imperfections to be found.  They hold their points well, and don't crumble and break like Prismacolors often do.  The colour lay down is pretty effortless, they layer well, and the pencils are highly pigmented.  All in all, I'm VERY happy with my purchase and won't hesitate to purchase more Arteza pencils in the future.","Reviewed in the United States on 10 January 2020","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

That’s a huge plus...So, I’ve used and own several brands of colored pencils, I’m not a professional artist.Although something went terribly wrong on my order and it took a long time to arrive originally was to arrive on 4th but arrived on evening of the 7th.. being a prime item and was promised delivery on 4th- that did bother me & chat was zero help.I want to specify Amazon chat not arteza.So shipping issues need to be approved on.ON THE PRODUCT NOW:)Worth the purchase-but price is a bit inflated in my opinion.Arteza should rethink this increase on price.Myself -if it continues to increase as it currently has been I won’t buy again. I’m partial to PRISMA, however,These are softer than most other WAX pencils on the market other than PRISMA premier. Thus giving Arteza an edge above others on sheerness and layering ability.These are quality I will give 5 stars on that.I noticed that some of the darker colors do tend to be harder leads and thus blending the darker ones lessens.They are a smoother lay down than other comparable brands.DO NOT confuse these with oil based or watercolor pencils as those are different and lay down differently. Arteza has watercolor pencils as well. Make sure you order correct as I have made that error 😂These are wax based.I’ve compared several brands to these and these are more like PRISMA than other brands.If I were comparing these wax based to an oil based pencil, Castle arts oil based run a close second in smoothness.. for an oil base brand.Anyhow, back to Arteza 😍The blunting of the tips I think is to prevent breaking during shipping so you’ll want to hone the tips by using them or a quick  mini turn in a sharpener will remedy it.I had no issue using my hand sharpener to do it, onlyTook one turn to achieve a point.These are harder leads BUT SOFT LET ME BE CLEAR THESE ARE VERY NICE CREAMY PENCILS and less breaking is a good quality on any pencil.So all In all these are worth the purchase for quality, blending and color ability.The colors are PHENOMENAL I love they differ in all aspects as they add more choices to my collection. So, you will be happy with these...Price point I’d definitely say is good but the recent increases has me a bit cranky.. I’d rate these around a 50-60.00 dollar USD for the 120 set. 80.00 seems a tad HIGH.But I’m not judging just one person’s opinion 😍You can’t go wrong purchasing these though, any artist expert or beginner would find these workable and desirable.I tried to purchase the 120 set as it was prime item and delivery was next day, however once order was placed it said it would be 5 days so that upset me and I cancelled it because that shouldn’t be happening on prime delivery items.I was very dissatisfied with that aspect and I couldn’t get a straight answer from Amazon.As I won’t let that reflect my product option 😎That issue shouldn’t really be sellers fault, I was bummed that I wasn’t able to get my 120 set as promised right now. But maybe I’ll try again in the future because these are EXCELLENT pencils.So if you need them ASAP ask about arrival time from Amazon I’m not sure if it’s due to holidays but it was upsetting I ordered them specifically because I was getting next day PRIME delivery And didn’t..And it’s unfortunate there seems to be some discrepancy on shipping.","Reviewed in Germany on 2 July 2020","3.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Each layer has 24 different shades of colours. Each true to its shade.Each colour blends perfectly. I love the way these work. The more you play with them the better techniques you find too. I found many ways to work with them once I started playing around.On different styles of paper and card you can get different effects. Its worth trying each to find your favourite to work with. My favourite being on the card in the picture above. They also work well on canvas card and watercolour card.These leave a stunning shine to the colours. No lines at all left behind, all blended well and they're smooth on most types of card.The pencils are very nice to work with. They do not scratch the paper, they're smooth and creamy and glide across the paper/card. The colour comes out really strong whether using it lightly or pressing harder for shading.I'm no artist, I love the draw and I get through pencil crayons quite quickly so I needed to find some good quality ones.Now these are creamy as I said, when doing deep colouring you can use up more pencil than you want to. I would prefer this and have a smooth colouring journey than cheaper pencils that do not give enough colour and leave lines behind!I did have an issue with my first box, the leads were broken within the crayons so when I was sharpening, they were falling out mostly. After speaking to arteza customer service via email, I received fantastic support and was sent a new pack straight away. My second pack has no issues.I would definitely recommend these pencil crayons. They really are amazing quality. True to colour. Work in many different ways.

For those purposes I would highly recommend them.  The color choice in the 72 set is excellent, though some could use more depth in shade and I wish there were a really dark inky blue color, however this set is more than enough to blend and get colors you want.  They are very soft in lay down and sharpen to a nice point which does not easily break as some brands do.  They layer and blend reasonably well though not as good as my Polychromos do but I did not expect that at this price point.  I love some of the colors, the pinks and purples and greens are well represented.  The big downside to sets like this is that you cannot buy individual pencils when one wears out, this is a huge disadvantage to someone like myself.  I like to be able to buy only the colors I use the most as often as I need to without buying a whole set.  I got this set for travel purposes, and it will be great for that.  It comes beautifully packaged in a metal tin with 3 layers.  The metal tin is covered in cellophane and then put into a sturdy form fitting box and then shipped in the Amazon box.  Because of this the pencils arrived in one piece with no damage.  Kudos for the packaging.  I can certainly recommend these pencils and they would be great for anyone starting out or who does not want to spend a fortune.  All in all a very good buy and I do not think you will be disappointed as long as you understand these are not the same as Polychromos, or Pablo's or other high end brands.","Reviewed in France on 9 June 2019","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

As they are, I’d categorize my set as a craft-level set, not a professional-level set. Nice pigmentation but limited usage (yes to coloring and cardmaking, no to blending gradients or multimedia work). Annoyingly, water doesn’t move it enough to use as watercolor pencils, but it moves it enough to smear the artwork. I’ve never been able to get a nice dry blend from watercolor pencils, which must have been the accidental mix-up that happened here (I think they crossed formulas accidentally). I have received a refund, Arteza has good customer service. But they also said they aren’t sure when the issue will be fully solved, so maybe don’t order these pencils for a while just to be save. I am satisfied with their customer service. I will have to reorder these maybe next birthday.The 72 set currently is on sale enough to make it crafting-level pricing, if you’re a crafter with no need for blending/gradients and water-related uses (multimedia, resist, use both sides of the paper). The 120 set is a bit pricy for craft-level supplies as of yet, for the specific set I received. There have been some awesome reviews, over years, so it’s probably just the one batch. Still, buyer beware. But great customer service.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 July 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

They behave just like watercolours, except better. You can get very fine detail with these, they blend wonderfully, and - what I'm happiest with - they are perfect for creating a base sketch without risking smudging, or visible linework, like you get when using pencil/graphite.This set is a great intro to watercolour pencils, and probably a great set for an intermediate watercolourist as well.

Los he usado en libros para colorear y te aceptan dos o tres capas en ese tipo de papel (bristol), lo que me gusta porque con acuarelas de pastilla o tubo la hoja se pone muy rugosa por tanta agua, en cambio con los lápices tengo más control. En papel de acuarela de 300 g también acepta algunas capas y puedes detallar el dibujo con otro tipo de lápices. Para activarlos uso el pincel con depósito de agua que ya tenía de la misma marca y la verdad es que me funciona muy bien. Los colores se vuelven vibrantes al contacto con el agua, sin necesidad de aplicar demasiado pigmento ni demasiada agua. Son un muy buen regalo para gente creativa.

Molto nera e quasi ""grassa"", è poco cancellabile come se fosse una matita colorata ed in breve è diventata la mia preferita (allego la palette dell'intero set, a lato di un piccolo bozzetto che feci tempo fa per esemplificare l'uso delle varie gradazioni di grafite).È allora che sono venuto a conoscenza di questo nuovo tipo di matite della Staedtler, sempre Mars Lumograph ma di tipo ""Black"", anch'esse in grafite ma di colore molto più nero del normale per la presenza di una più alta percentuale di carbone; vedendole in vendita qui su Amazon, le ho acquistate per curiosità.Fatta esclusione per la 8B del set Mars Lumograph ""normale"" che è del tutto simile con la 8B di tipo ""Black"", le altre gradazioni non sono da confondere però, in quanto a resa grafica, né con quelle in normale grafite né con le matite a carboncino.Delle prime non hanno quei fastidiosi riflessi lucidi avendo una finitura opaca, e delle seconde non possiedono la friabilità propria del carbone.Sono pastose e poco cancellabili come se fossero delle matite colorate nere, ma a differenza di queste sono sfumabili anche con le dita, hanno una mina resistentissima e molto affilabile, e soprattutto sono di quattro gradazioni diverse: la confezione comprende due matite di gradazione 2B, due 4B, una 6B e una 8B.Io le uso spesso e con piacere perché queste matite Black consentono agli amanti di questo tipo di tecnica, semplicemente ripassando un sottile strato sulle zone fatte con la grafite normale dove si vuole che sia reso un nero più profondo, di attenuare anche l'effetto lucido tipico della grafite.Queste Mars Lumograph Black sono un complemento anche per chi ama disegnare con il carboncino: le rifiniture, i particolari e le ombre più scure possono essere aggiunte con profitto dopo la stesura del fissatore ottenendo risultati molto convincenti.Allego tra le immagini il confronto tra la matita Lumograph in normale grafite di gradazione 8B e la sua ""gemella"" 8B Lumograph Black: entrambe hanno la mina di diametro maggiore delle altre gradazioni: ben 4,5 mm., mentre per le Black 6B, 4B e 2B il diametro è di 3,6.Le Mars Lumograph Black sono contenute in una pratica scatola metallica con una funzionale cerniera apribile (molto comoda per coloro che disegnano sovente anche all'aperto o in altre svariate condizioni ambientali), ed inoltre, al di là dell'abituale eleganza, riportano intelligentemente su ognuna delle sei facce la gradazione (caratteristica comodissima per un disegnatore).Consiglio a tutti gli appassionati di disegno, professionisti e non, l'acquisto delle Lumograph black, perché la resa è in definitiva qualcosa di diverso: diverso dalle grafiti, diverso dai carboncini, diverso dalle matite colorate. Si ha un ibrido di cui davvero si sentiva la mancanza a livello grafico.P.S.:Ora che sto scrivendo noto che ne hanno prodotto un kit in cui le matite Lumograph Black sono tutte di gradazioni diverse, avendo aggiunto la HB e la 7B: le acquisterò non appena ""nanizzate"" queste.Spero di esservi stato utile.","Reviewed in Italy on 27 June 2019","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Having them split into two lines gives so much more options. They are nice & dark, as dark as Cretacolor Neros & darker than Faber Castell Matte but not as smooth as either, you can feel just a bit of grab on the paper. You can erase but minimally & smudging/blending with stumps or tortillons is also minimal but that helps make sketchbook drawings stay less messy.

I have bought several without regret. But spending just a few dollars more for a box of Staedtlers is worth it. I do think they sharpen better with less lead breakage and last longer, but that could be me just getting better at sharpening (yes, there is a knack to it). The nicest touch is how the hardness value is imprinted on all six faces of the hexagon, so you can locate the one you want without having to rotate pencils to see the label. I don't know of any other pencil brand that has this. Remember that there are two different 12-packs--this one, which is mostly softer leads, and another that emphasizes the harder ones. Amazon can be overpriced for some art supplies, but not here--this is a very good price for this product compared to art stores and other online sellers.

V.","He usado todo tipo de lápices 'negros' para los tonos oscuros, desde grafitos de distintas marcas, pasando por carbones normales, comprimidos, grasos, los Conté 1720, pasteles negros ... Bien por vaguería o porque soy demasiado principiante para darme cuenta, voy buscando un tipo de lápiz que me permita negros intensos, pero que luego no tenga que andar con fijadores para que no se me vaya o se traspase a la hoja de al lado. Los Conté igual se acercaban un poco pero siguen manchando allá por donde pasan.Estos cayeron en mis manos después de ver varios análisis. Al principio me resultaba algo extraña la sensación, ya que no son suaves como un grafito, son como una cera dura, pero los resultados me gustaron mucho. Alcanzan negros mucho más intensos que un grafito (aunque el Steadtler normal 8B no está nada mal) y no tienes ese brillo del grafito que puede ser molesto. A medida que los usas y te acostumbras vas obteniendo mejores resultados y te van gustando más. Se quedan bastante bien en el papel, no difuminan mal, no manchan ni necesitan de fijador.

They are presented in a nice metal tin which provides good protection and easy access. The highly distinctive blue, silver and black top livery is iconic and it hasn't changed in years.I have used these pencils before and they have never let me down. This set is excellent for building up tone in portrait or landscape sketches for example. They sharpen well without splintering, and are comfortable to hold and use. The graphite is super smooth on paper and does not scratch at all like cheaper pencils. The graphite also erases easily so you can perfect your work. There is something very nice and satisfying about a good quality pencil like this one. This is a great set for any artist or student alike.

I would first like to say I’m a fan of both brands but neither is my all time favorite brand, so I sway neither direction in a biased opinion.  So let’s begin. After a scale hardness check, these pencils were exactly on scale where they are claiming to be. Paint on these pencils are very nice. While holding them, they feel exactly like the regular Lumos. And after a few hours of testing these, I will admit that these are better than the regular Lumograph set, and they are slightly above the faber-9000 series, however, they fall short of being as good as the faber Pitt-Matte set.  Why?  Well they just don’t have that matte charcoal finish that the Pitt set is able to achieve. I have also did a review on that set if you happen to stumble across it here on Amazon.  Listen, don’t get me wrong, these pencils are definitely in a serious race here. And could possibly be in the top 5th or 6th place of the best woodcase pencils being made. And I don’t have to tell you there are thousands of wood case pencil companies. Hundreds of them claiming to be the best artist grade pencils.  If you can make it into the top 10 on my list, your pencils are definitely worth buying. And these Lumo Blacks are definitely on my list. These are the types of pencils that make you want to draw. I know you are not bound down to artistic creativity by tools, however, any artist will tell you, you can only get as good as the tool will let you.  So when you by cheap supplies, your progress will only go so far before you must upgrade to better supplies or your abilities will fall short of your capable talents.  ...A set like this will not only help you achieve better work, but will also make you strive to push them and yourself to higher levels of progression. I definitely suggest buying this set and testing them out for yourself. Or if you are also a collector like myself, add this set into your collection. I always buy 2 sets of every pencil so I will always have a brand new set to put into my massive pencil collection.

PERFECTOS!! Son blandos, se difuminan por completo sin dejar rastro de las rayas y por un precio increíble. El dark es absolutamente genial, y el blanco para dar luces aclara algo, pero en un papel  crema por ejemplo daría unas lunes geniales. El envío rapidísimo, enviado un lunes y recibido un martes.

"1802","Derwent Drawing Colouring Pencils, Drawing & Writing, Set Of 12, Ideal For Illustrating & Detailing, Professional Quality, 0700671","Amazing Colored Pencils!","Toyah","Years ago, I was introduced to Derwent Drawing pencils as part of a promo and received a 6 piece set through an art supply vendor. As a colored pencil artist, I was soon amazed at the quality, pigment and feel of these pencils. I liked them so much that I decided to recently upgrade to the full 24 set and saw that Amazon had a fantastic price.The colors in this set are subtle, beautiful shades that I could not find in other sets of popular pencils.  These pencils are truly the elite artist grade colored pencil, in that they are super creamy/waxy and pigmented and layer flawlessly. Though they appear to be marketed for rendering animals, they are equally impressive for rendering flesh tones, and architectural pieces. They work very well combined with other pencils and layer well with oil-based or wax-based brands. The sensory feel of these cross between a wax- based and oil-based colored pencil but with wider leads. From what I've observed, they leave no wax bloom or excessive residue. The pigments are intense that you can go over several previous layers of colored pencil (other brands) and easily leave rich, broad strokes.  They are perfect for final detailed accents on pieces. The Chinese White pencil in the set is also perfect for highlighting over layers of pencil, and covers well on darker papers.As for being erasable, they will erase to a certain degree on most paper. Though, they do so very well on black, smoother illustration board. They don't erase as well on other papers, but I find that if I apply them over subsequent layers of colored pencil, they erase better.For these pencils, paper choice plays an important role. They are bit too rich and bold for regular sketching/copy paper. I find that they work beautifully on vellum bristol, illustration board and erase especially well on black illustration board. They also hold up well on artist professional grade drawing paper that has a weight of 90lb or more. If you are trying to achieve a smooth finish, I probably wouldn't use these on general sketchbook or heavy, broad toothed paper or you will see a lot of the paper's texture.For the colored pencil artist or those with special interest in drawing, these pencils are very much recommended. They're well made, of excellent quality in durability and lightfast ratings (the colors won't easily fade) and the leads last a long time. *Important: You will need a wider hole pencil sharpener for these. Something metal and durable.The Derwent brand pastel pencil sharper is perfect for these pencils.I cannot say enough good things about these amazing pencils and am fortunate to have acquired the full set!","Reviewed in Australia on 6 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1807","Derwent Drawing Colouring Pencils, Drawing & Writing, Set Of 12, Ideal For Illustrating & Detailing, Professional Quality, 0700671","Good selection of colours for drawing","oscar","I must now have five or six sets of Derwent pencils, but these, the latest are my favourites. They are a selection of browns, muted greens and blues, off whites and other naturalistic colours. For drawing and sketching naturalistic scenes I think they are a clever selection. You can always add others from the range for bright colours, but these bring a sense of understated beauty to your drawings.The pencils themselves are round with thick leads. they are quite soft - similar to Derwent's coloursoft range and do not hold a fine point for very long. I suggest that (1) you keep a good quality pencil sharpener close by and that (2) Derwent consider making a hexagonal finer leaded version for people who want to do detailed drawings.The colours, like most of Derwent's insoluble coloured pencils blend well if you don't put down too much at once. If you really scrub hard you'll end up with a slightly waxy bloom and it's difficult to put more colour on the top and blend the colours. Almost it acts like a wax resist when you try to pencil over, and definitely like a wax resist if you try to water colour over.If I have a problem with these (and for that matter, most coloured pencils) it's the white. It's pretty translucent. Which may be what it should be and maybe what you want. But I would like a white that was really opaque and you could use for highlights.In summary, if you're into naturalistic drawing these are a good selection and deliver; there's a smaller set for the cautious but I'm glad I got the whole 24.","Reviewed in Brazil on 2 April 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"
"1808","Derwent Drawing Colouring Pencils, Drawing & Writing, Set Of 12, Ideal For Illustrating & Detailing, Professional Quality, 0700671","絶妙なくすみカラー！","cwieck","色鉛筆といえば、手軽で使いやすい画材の代表で赤や黄色〜青や緑など、素直な色味のものというイメージがあったのですがこちらの色鉛筆はちょっと違い、ニュアンスのあるややくすんだ色で構成されています。抑え気味の自然な色味で、他とは違うシックな落ち着いた雰囲気が得られます。芯は太く（５mm）、柔らかいです。粉をワックスで固めた感じというか、どちらかというとマットな質感で、テカリはそんなにない感じ。何色か重ねると、スベってのりにくいことがあり、重ね塗りに向いてるとは言えないかも。とはいえ、私自身が何色も重ねて緻密に色味を作るような描き方を必要としない上、そのままの色味が十分に美しいので、たとえグリグリと無理やり重ねてタッチがヘンな感じになってもそれはそれで面白い効果になるようにも思います。（あくまで自分の場合）芯の太さと柔らかさから、細かい部分を塗るよりも勢いのあるドローイングで使ったら、なんかカッコよく描けた気になります。自然を美しく描きたいとか、古風な画面を作りたいとか、抑え気味の色味で個性を出したいとか、そういうのにもぴったりかと。とても好きな色鉛筆です。追記: 色の見本追加しました。公式サイトの色見本よりも、実物のほうが少しくすんだ色のような気がします。モニターにもよると思うので、参考程度に。本当にシックな良い色です。","Reviewed in France on 18 August 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1812","Derwent Drawing Colouring Pencils, Drawing & Writing, Set Of 12, Ideal For Illustrating & Detailing, Professional Quality, 0700671","Beautiful Pencils. Gorgeous Saturated Colours, are Creamy and Perfect for Nature.","Toyah","Derwent Drawing Pencils are creamy, rich coloured pencils with a dreamy colour palate suitable for landscapes- nature studies, wildlife studies and portraiture. I had originally purchased the 6 pc set, just to try them out. Due to some of the issues I had experienced with the Coloursoft coloured pencils, I did not want to splurge on these just yet. Almost immediately I fell in love with them. These are richly pigmented, and when creating the swatches I knew I had to upgrade. The colours offered here in the 24 pc set (their largest) are gorgeous, earthy tones, and the performance of these pencils are outstanding. Rich pigments, vibrant colours that layer and blend exquisitely. Like the Coloursoft, and the Artists pencils, these barrels are thick, and the 5mm lead allows for a lot of pigment on that lay-down.The issues are minimal. Price - these are expensive. The prices here on Amazon are the best I was able to find and these pencils are worth the asking price. Another minor negative is the thickness of the pencils may get in the way when colouring in, or drawing the tiny details in your pieces. Also their largest set of 24 colours may be limiting to some, and although the colours offered here are just what’s needed for nature and animal studies, you may still be yearning for more colour options (as evidenced when drawing the unfinished dog attached. I had to default to the Coloursoft pencils for the tongue's red tones). These are meant to be more of a companion piece to your other Derwent pencils; Coloursoft, Artists, ProColour, so for further colour options, just reach for whatever set you have. Currently I own the Coloursoft (36), Studio (36), and Artists (72). The Drawing pencils are my favourite so far of the Derwent line.Overall, Derwent Drawing Coloured pencils are fantastic. The 24 pc set is what is recommended as you get the full colour palette in a convenient tin. These are my go to pencils whenever I want to draw anything with four legs and is covered in fur, and those soft, dreamy landscapes. Although these may not be the best pencils for colouring books due to their theme specific colour selection, they perform beautifully, laying down gorgeous and saturated colours, and is recommended for artists of all levels.","Reviewed in Australia on 6 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

The colours are perfect for such subjects.The pencils themselves have a comfortable circular barrel, a smooth warm brown varnish and an elegant dipped end showing the colour of the core of the pencil.The core is soft and easy to blend, a slightly waxy texture, it goes onto paper smoothly and shades well with light pressure and gives intense colour with firmer pressure.  The core holds a point nicely - perfect for when drawing fur.Excellent Derwent quality as expected.","Reviewed in Brazil on 30 May 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"
"1825","Derwent Drawing Colouring Pencils, Drawing & Writing, Set Of 12, Ideal For Illustrating & Detailing, Professional Quality, 0700671","Softest Coloured Pencils Ever!","Marcos da Costa Martins","These pencils are absolutely incredible! They have a fast lay down and blend out with oms very well. The Derwent Drawing Pencils are arguably the softest coloured pencils on the market. They do sometimes break but the quality of the pencils are very good so it doesn’t happen too often, unlike prismacolor.They come in a muted earthy palette suitable for landscapes, wildlife and portraiture. Because of this they wouldn’t be a great set to start off with but a set you would purchase once you already have an established coloured pencil set to use along side of them.All of them are highly lightfast with 23 scoring an 8 on the blue wool scale and one scoring a 7.Overall they are an extremely excellent pencil that I would recommend to almost any coloured pencil artist to add to their collection!","Reviewed in Spain on 20 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

They are so good that I bought the 24 set. It's a limited palette, but just enough for portraits and figure studies. I was using another famous brand, but I became disillusioned when I found out that many of their colors are nowhere near permanent. Derwent, although more expensive, provides pencils with highly permanent pigments.This set is very much like one that I would build; mostly earth colors with subdued blues and greens. It's specifically designed for realistic landscapes, plus human and animal portraits.I'll probably get a few spectral colors from the Derwent Coloursoft set.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 July 2011","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I've used them on both pastel paper and bristol board and they worked fine on both.  The white and black in this line are really the best.  The black in this is much darker than my prismacolor black pencil.  These are much softer than prismacolor pencils.  Imagine a combination between prismacolor premier pencils and oil pastels.  I like the smudgy way they blend.  These however are not for everyone.  My prismacolor's hold a point better.  These would be rubbish for detailed adult coloring books because they do not hold a point very well.  People were commenting in the reviews that they liked them for portraits.  I'm a portrait artist and I've done a portrait with them but I didn't love them for that purpose.  They were perfect for drawing furry animals.  I love the color range.  It's really well thought out. Great greys for shadows.  I do not recommend these for lots of tiny detail work, you'll be wasting them sharpening like crazy.  I love these to pieces but will be buying some Faber Castell Polychromos for my most detailed work.Something important to know about these.  They are incredibly lightfast, that's not common for colored pencils.  All but one has the highest lightfast rating of 8 and the one that doesn't is a 7.  This is important to me because I sell my originals and wouldn't want my work to fade on my customers.These work great with my prismacolor pencils so I often use both in the piece.  The nose on the tiger drawing is the only part where I used prismacolor instead because there is no pink in the derwent drawing pencils set.","Reviewed in the United States on 27 December 2023","3.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Die Qualität, Verarbeitung und Haltbarkeit sind ausgezeichnet und halten, was sie versprechen.

Die Farben sind kräftig und lassen sich leicht, ohne großen Druck zu Papier bringen. Ideal für kleine Malanfänger. Einen Stern Abzug, da die Spitzen der Stifte schnell abbrechen, sobald sie auf den Boden fallen. Also sollte ein Spitzer beim Malen griffbereit sein.

"1930","Triangular Colouring Pencil - STABILO Trio thick short - Pack of 12 - Assorted Colours","STABILO Trio thick - La scelta perfetta per le prime avventure artistiche della mia bimba di 2 anni!","The Doc","Non potrei essere più soddisfatto dell'astuccio STABILO Trio thick da 24 colori che ho acquistato per la mia bimba di 2 anni. Questi pastelli sono stati un vero e proprio successo nelle sue prime avventure artistiche, e non posso che elogiare la loro qualità e versatilità.Fin dal momento in cui ho aperto l'astuccio, ho potuto percepire la cura e l'attenzione nei dettagli che STABILO ha messo in questi pastelli. Il design ergonomico e la forma triangolare sono perfetti per le manine piccole della mia bimba. Ha potuto afferrare i pastelli con facilità e iniziare a sperimentare senza problemi.La gamma di colori è semplicemente sbalorditiva. I colori sono vibranti e luminosi, catturando immediatamente l'attenzione e stimolando la creatività della mia bimba. La varietà di tonalità consente di creare opere d'arte vivaci e fantasiose, anche per una piccola artista in erba.Una delle caratteristiche che ho trovato particolarmente preziose è la resistenza dei pastelli. La punta spessa e robusta resiste bene alle pressioni più energiche, perfetta per un bambino di 2 anni che potrebbe essere un po' troppo entusiasta con la sua creatività. Ho notato che i pastelli sono durevoli e non si rompono facilmente, anche quando vengono applicate forti pressioni.La facilità con cui i pastelli si stendono sulla carta è un altro punto a favore. La morbidezza del tratto consente alla mia bimba di colorare in modo uniforme e senza sforzi e ha reso il suo processo di apprendimento artistico molto più gratificante.Inoltre, ho apprezzato la facilità con cui i colori si lavano dalla pelle e dai vestiti. Questo è un grande vantaggio quando si tratta di materiali artistici per i più piccoli.In conclusione, l'astuccio STABILO Trio thick da 24 colori è stata una scelta eccezionale per introdurre la mia bimba di 2 anni nel mondo dell'arte. La qualità, la varietà di colori e la facilità d'uso lo rendono uno strumento perfetto per stimolare la sua creatività e offrire ore di divertimento. Consiglio vivamente questi pastelli a tutti i genitori in cerca di un'opzione affidabile e di alta qualità per le prime esperienze artistiche dei loro bambini.Se hai trovato la mia recensione utile utilizza il tasto qui sotto.","Reviewed in Italy on 18 August 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

It is pricy but when it is on offer it is ideal.I like Rotring pens/pencils and I find that they are nice to write with.  The only problem I have had with previous pencils is that the nib mechanisim seems to fail with me.  Bit early for this one but I'm hoping the 600 works with no issues and lasts me a long time.The pencil is all metal and has a nice weight/feel to it with the weight more towards the nib.  The gnarled surface at the nib end is just the right size when holding it.  I bought the 0.5mm which I prefer to write with.At the other end it has a rotator selector for different types of lead; 2H, 4H, 2B, B, HB, F, H.  I guess you select these depending on the size of lead you end up putting in it.I bought the green, it is quite dark which is great - could be describes as a forest green?I liked it so much I ended up buying a 600 pen to go with it.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 July 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

The weight of the pencil seems heavy at first, but I'd say it's a good type of heavy. They're smaller in length compared to standard plastic mechanical pencils, but feel perfect in the hand. Additionally, the grip is very satisfying to hold and isn't too rough on the fingers.Overall, this is a great mechanical pencil. A definite step up from the 500.

"2020","Derwent34214 Graphic Medium Graphite Drawing Pencils, Set of 12, Professional Quality, Black","Derwents are some of the best around","Mz Nina, business consultant and aspiring artist","I looove this brand, also all their colored pencil lines.  I know everyone is Prismacolor crazy, but it is hype.  Derwents are just as good and I am a little partial to them simply they are the ones I learn to draw with even as a kid.  I remember my first Derwent kit that Dad bought me, 120 pencils and I was around 8 and we were livi9ng in Australia.I love the water color pencils, the graphite, the ink tense that you can actually draw on fabric with and it stays, and the color soft line.  I also have a few others, but those are my favorites.I would say there pencils are as good as any other including Prismacolor.Just make sure to get the right pencil sharpener no matter what you use.  Get a Derwent battery operated, which is still made or a Panasonic or a used HUNT-Boston, all of which are no longer made.  DO NOT GET X-ACTO, it chews your pencils up and constantly breaks the lead.INFO ON ELECTRIC PENCIL SHARPENERS:I am a color pencil artist, and you need to have either a Panasonic, ""Hunt-Boston"" pencil sharpener, otherwise your colored pencils are eaten.  NEVER BUY X-ACTO for colored pencils, X-ACTO will eat your pencils.  Until you can find a Panasonic or Hunt-Boston, or Hunt or Boston electric pencil sharpener, get this if you can find one, or the Derwent ""BLACK"" model as it had 2 holes, one for a longer tip and one for a shorter tip.  I have both.  I had bought the Derwent one as I have Derwent but also use Prismacolor and graphite.  Panasonic and Hunt Boston are NO LONGER MADE no matter WHAT anyone says.  I was lucky to buy a new PANASONIC electric pencil sharpener by trolling the net until I found on.  Bought a used Boston, model #18, used on eBay and paid waaaay too much.  It was pretty beaten up.Also, if you do buy used, get one in the best quality that you can and just pay the extra, I would say up to $35.  I personally would not spend more than that.  I paid $38 for my new Panasonic.Also, X-ACTO bought out ""Hunt-Boston"" and all new models are a 4 digit model number, the actual ""Hunt-Boston"" is only a 2 digit.  This issue is that X-ACTO still sells under the Hunt Boston name, and it is misleading as it now uses X-ACTO cutters, which do NOTHING but EAT your pencils.  I also do not like it when someone lies about what they are selling.I bought what I thought was a ""HUNT"" electric pencil sharpener, it came in a box that had the Hunt name and packaging, but when I opened it up it was a, you guessed right...  An X-ACTO!!  Said so right on the sharpener.Bought on line here at Amazon from Overstock.com, but I returned it and got a refund, including shipping as they were misleading.Hope this helps with those of you who are colored pencil artist.  Get a PANASONIC, HUNT-BOSTON or Derwent sharpener.Also, run a graphite pencil through your sharpener first thing every day and it will stay sharp longer since colored pencils are waxy and tend to build up on the cutters.","Reviewed in the United States on 18 February 2013","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"2028","Derwent34214 Graphic Medium Graphite Drawing Pencils, Set of 12, Professional Quality, Black","前買った時よりマシになっている。","Amazonカスタマー","以前６本セット缶を購入したが、「芯がボキボキ折れてまともに削れない」（実質使用不可能）という恐るべき低劣品質だった。今回缶デザインがリニューアル、もしかして品質も改善されているかもと購入してみた。ら、今のところ削っても折れない（！！）缶自体、かつての６本缶のペラい質感のものよりしっかりしているし、缶のプリント塗装も上質な感じ。蓋の下、鉛筆の上からラッピングされており、固定されてガチャつかず輸送されてきたのも勝因か。ダーウェントはヨーロッパメーカー（カランダッシュ除く）的に乾いた手応え、ステッドラーより肌理は粗め。が、粗過ぎない適度な肌理。今回H硬度も試したくミディアムを選んだが、かなり粗めでひっかかりのあるH硬度。発色は薄いが肌理が粗いのでソフトに感じる。B硬度は「こんなにネットリしてたっけ？」、全体に「こんなに粗かったっけ？」な印象。ガリガリした粒子もH硬度からB硬度全てにもれなく頻繁に出るので、肌理細かい効果を求める人には全くお勧めしない。概して缶蓋の作品にあるような木炭デッサンみたいなちょっとソリッドなタッチになる（向いている）。特筆すべき注意点は、表面が滑らかな傾向にある日本的な紙には向かない（粗いくせにツルツル滑って乗りにくい）。以前買った時より鉛筆の塗装は良くなっている（２分割した木の継ぎ目が目立たないし塗装も厚めになってムラも無い）。が、木の接着がスムースではなく、電動では問題無いが小型削り器ではガタガタと無理な力がかかってささくれがち、その振動で芯が折れやすい（やはり芯はもろい）。HBでも尖らせた芯先が砕けて折れやすい。定着もズバ抜けて悪く摩擦で紙面が汚れがち。以上、品質的にはドイツ・日本・スイス製より圧倒的に劣るが、肌理のある、鉛筆向きの紙にサリサリとドライな手応えで描きたい自分的には納得づくでの買い物。ただし、缶は蝶番が無い、蓋が分離するタイプ。さらに携帯すると中が偏ってバラバラになり不便。こういった缶の仕様だし、芯もあいかわらず強くはないので衝撃には注意したほうがいい。（使用始めで主に硬い硬度中心に使っているので、B硬度に使用に耐える強度があるのかは疑心暗鬼。使い物にならないようなら追記します）★ ちなみに下位ラインの『アカデミー』シリーズは違う（恐らく中国製）が、こちらは英国製。","Reviewed in Japan on 23 October 2018","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"
"2029","Derwent34214 Graphic Medium Graphite Drawing Pencils, Set of 12, Professional Quality, Black","9h softer than 8h, otherwise perfect pencils.","Victor J. Martinez","So I did swatches of all the pencils I received (bought 12 hard and 12 soft sets) and was surprised at how dark 9h looked. I then start a swatch with 8h and it was much lighter. I thought maybe I just pressed lighter on the 8h, I continued with the rest of the pencils, and everything was perfect. So I did more comparisons of 8h and 9h with drawing lines, different shading, etc, and 9h is definitely darker than 8h, but whatever, I at least now know what to expect from both those pencils, probably just a lull in quality assurance that day. So a star off for that, butt other than that, great pencils, will buy again for their great price and (hopefully more reliable) quality.","Reviewed in the United States on 17 December 2015","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

This is the first tin I have gotten that has a damaged pencil in see photo it doesn’t look like it ruined the core of the pencil thankfully. For some of the reviews that mention only getting them in a tin without a lid and just the bottom shrink wrapped(the only difference is the lid not being there it’s still only the bottom shrink wrapped even if you get a lid not sure why they do that.) I would blame Derwent for that more than Amazon as even retail stores like hobby lobby get tins like that.","Reviewed in the United States on 21 October 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I've had my teacher tell several other students that their supplies weren't adequate but has always just focused on showing me how to use mine. I don't know too much about pencils but if you're looking for a great starter range I would recommend this set.The only down side I have for the pencils is that the case doesn't allow for easy viewing and the pencils fall out fairly easily. However, I didn't really consider the case a huge deal because it stores them perfectly in transit. I just think it would be nice if the pencils snapped in and had a label along the bottom (not on the pencil) to know which pencil you're grabbing (because the pencils will rotate in the case).","Reviewed in the United States on 4 November 2013","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I Had to remove bits of the broken lead (and the other two leads inside the pencil), make sure no small lengths left inside, then very carefully insert a single 0.35 lead and started again. This problem seems to be solved - so far - now that there is only one 0.35 lead in the pencil. This is a mechanical issue, not the leads in the pencils. These are excellent and produce smooth and consistent marks on the paper used. In conclusion: Initial disappointment from usual excellent Faber-Castell products but will monitor and report back.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 April 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Before I bought this product I was trying to find packs of professional drawing pencils that had great quality to them. I never seemed to LOVE the packs I'd buy until I bought this.This tin includes 12 professional grade pencils (6B to 4H). I love that all of these pencils come in a metal tin for safe keeping. My other pencils I would throw into the cup that holds my micron pens and primsacolor pencils and it took forever to find the size I needed for my drawing. This metal tin is super lightweight which makes travel so much easier and handy. There's a divot in the tin for each of the 12 pencils keeping them from breaking or getting damaged. The pencils come already sharpened. You can't beat the price for this type of quality which is why I trust Arteza products. They are all affordable and you get the same quality product that you would if you paid more for the expensive brands.If you're looking for professional sketching pencils look no farther.

I teach piano and I am constantly copying off pages of music so I can highlight aspects in colour for students. I find this works much better for students than everything in black. However, I'm never sure that pupils should go into exams with books covered in coloured markings. After one pupil found it hard to play the piece when we switched from the colour page to the plain music, I thought it would be brilliant if you could rub out colours in the way you can pencil. And so I found these. They make good strong markings on the page as long as they are sharp. I can't comment on colouring in, I'm afraid, as I've only used them for writing in colour.I'm being brave now and writing over all sorts of things in colour on the assumption I can rub it out later.

Der Clou an den Buntstiften ist, dass sie sich wie gewöhnliche Bleistifte wegradieren lassen sollen. Dementsprechend ist an jedem Stift ein weißes Radiergummi angebracht.Die Buntstifte haben eine gute Farbvielfalt und lassen sich angenehm auftragen. Ich nutze sie vor allen Dingen zum Skizzieren von Aquarellen oder Projekten mit Alkoholmarkern, da Buntstifte kein Graphit enthalten, was sich störend mit den Farben vermengen kann.Bei leichten Skizzen lassen sich die Stifte auch angenehm radieren. Eine leichte Farbtönung ist dennoch zu sehen, vollständig bekommt man die Pigmente also nicht mehr vom Papier. Dies zeigt sich besonders, wenn man einmal ein wenig fester drückt: je mehr Pigment auf die Seiten kommt, desto mehr schmiert die Farbe und desto weniger wirkt das Radiergummi. Darauf sollten vor allen Dingen Menschen mit einem festeren Zeichenstil achten. Für leichte Skizzen oder sanfte Schattierungen sind die Bundstifte aber auf jeden Fall geeignet.","Reviewed in Germany on 21 August 2020","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"2206","Faber-Castell Grip 1345 0.5mm Mechanical Pencil - Green ","After 4 months still working amazing.","Vince","I bought this pencil as a student in high school and honestly, it just blew me away. I love the feel and color of the pencil, as well as how amazingly it works. After a while, I really got used to the twist eraser and have found it useful so many times. However, the eraser refills from faber castell were way too expensive and I had trouble finding a cheaper replacement with the right thickness to fit in the holding container. However I did find one on amazon, the Factis BM-2 mechanical eraser refills give a lot more for cheaper, as long as you're willing to cut the erasers to the right length.It's an easy to disassemble pencil to diagnose any errors, something I had to do after dropping it a bunch after spinning it in class. Just remove the eraser casing by pulling it out (or else it will shoot out when you pull out the front part of the pencil) turn the grip counter clockwise until it's loose from the pencil until it's loose, then just pull. I am also really satisfied with the pencil grip, however it has gotten a little loose (not loose enough to feel any difference when writing, it just makes it a little hard when you're turning it to disassemble it) so it get's harder to disassemble the pencil (although you'd rarely do that, but that's why 4 stars) and you can fix it by adding a little glue or adhesive to the grip, which is also removeable. All in all really good pencil that's served a grade 12 High School student well, just keep in mind that you'll have to buy specialized eraser refills that are a little difficult to find.","Reviewed in Canada on 15 January 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Update: I have recently had to buy other makes of 2B pencil and I can state that none have been anywhere near as good as these by Oxford.  Even more expensive pencils are nowhere near as a good.  I have been given, as presents, some very highly regarded and very expensive types of pencils which have allegedly been used by high profile and famous writers and authors and these Oxford pencils beat them all, in my opinion.

Il materiale più morbido rispetto al legno consente un'impugnatura migliore.L'immagine trae in inganno, pensavo fossero flessibili, non lo sono.😊PRO- Non hanno legno, coscienza ecologica salva!- impugnatura comoda- classica mina di grafite, si cancella con solita gomma per matita- si tempera con normale temperino da matite classiche😬CONTRO- pensavo che la protezione dagli urti data da questo nuovo materiale indicata sulla scatola, proteggesse la mina dalle rotture, si riferisce invece al materiale stesso.Sono praticamente matite normali per le quali non hanno usato legno.Vi consiglio l'acquisto 🎄Spero che la recensione ti sia stata utile 😊","Reviewed in Italy on 27 January 2021","3.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Und auch die Verarbeitung und das leichte Gewicht sprechen eher für Billigware (obwohl sie bisher halten, wirkt das Plastik sehr instabil). Allerdings kann man bei 20€ für 50 Stück auch nicht viel dagegen sagen. Zweck ist ja eher Quantität statt Qualität hier.Mit dem Stift zu arbeiten hat sich bisher auch als gut erwiesen. Die Minen halten und breichen nicht zu schnell ab. Exakte Bauzeichnungen würde ich hiermit aber dennoch nicht machen, da die Mine doch relativ schnell grob-weiche Linien zeichnet.Ansonsten habe ich aber nicht gegen eine Weiterempfehlung einzuwenden. Wer eine große Menge für seine Kollegen benötigt, aber nicht viel Geld ausgeben möchte, ist hier richtig.
