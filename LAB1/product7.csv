"4","Pencil","STAEDTLER 121-2 BK5D Noris School Graphite Pencils - HB Degree (Pack of 5), Black","Bea","I got the STAEDTLER 122-2 Noris Pencil and it's solid for everyday use. It writes and sketches well with a comfy grip. The built-in eraser is handy for fixing mistakes.The positives: Writes smoothly, easy to use, comfy grip, and the eraser works for light fixes.The negatives: Eraser wears down fast, and the pencil feels a bit light. Erasing a lot might leave faint marks.Overall, it's a good pencil, but the eraser could be sturdier.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 April 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"
