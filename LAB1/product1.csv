The spiral binding is a gem, allowing me to spread out my ideas across both pages without any hassle. The paper quality is top-notch, handling my pencil and ink sketches with ease. It's robust enough to endure my frequent erasing and redrawing, a crucial factor for any artist. The environmental aspect of using 100% recycled paper adds a touch of responsibility to my art. This sketchbook has become an indispensable part of my daily sketching routine.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"6","Notebook","BLUE ACORN - A3 Portrait Spiral Bound Sketchbook - 35 Sheets 150gsm Multipurpose Cartridge Paper - Ideal for Light Washes of Paint, Pencils & Sketching","Ernestina","This sketch book is well made and uses high quality materials and paper which is thick enough not to have any ink or paint bleeding through to the other side which means you can use both sides of the paper without any issues. This has been perfect for my young daughter who loves painting and drawing and lasts longer due to being able to use both sides of the paper. The sketch book is quite sturdy with nice solid covers and a spiral binding. Highly recommended. At the time of review the price is £14.65 which I feel is a little on the pricey side despite the high quality.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 January 2024","4.0 out of 5 stars"

This is a lovely spiral bound sketchbook.  I much prefer spiral bound art books, diaries as they are so much easier to use, if you want to come back to a page, so much easier to turn.  The paper is a great quality and is suitable for a variety of medias.  I took a pic and on the back tells you which medias they recommend.  The size makes it ideal for larger compositions and also for framing. If you are going to frame a sketch etc you really don't want some A6 piece of paper!!!Happy to recommend, this supplier does loads of other craft items, so will have to take a peak at the rest of these, I have a lot of very arts and crafty friends, and I make up arts and crafts bundles for their birthdays.  If you know it is something that someone uses on a regular present you are not cluttering up their house with something unwanted ...","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 December 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars"

It gracefully accepts various mediums, from light washes to brush pens, without compromising the integrity of the paper. It's spacious, allowing for larger, more detailed works. The spiral binding is durable, handling frequent use without issue. It's an essential tool for anyone serious about their art, providing a reliable and versatile canvas for creative expression.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I always think describing it as 70 pages is a bit misleading. Personally I only ever draw on one side so counting both sides does not seem right but hey ho. The pages come spiral bound between ridged covers the back cover is particularly sturdy which is good as it will protect your drawings even if you are carrying them around. The paper is A3 and is a good quality 150 gsm smooth cartridge type paper. At 150gsm it is not the thickest but it is as described and is certainly adequate for sketching. I usually use a thicker paper but found this worked pretty well. All in all this is a very good quality pad and at a very reasonable price.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"
