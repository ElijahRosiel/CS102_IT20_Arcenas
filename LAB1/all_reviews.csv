"6","Notebook","BLUE ACORN - A3 Portrait Spiral Bound Sketchbook - 35 Sheets 150gsm Multipurpose Cartridge Paper - Ideal for Light Washes of Paint, Pencils & Sketching","Ernestina","This sketch book is well made and uses high quality materials and paper which is thick enough not to have any ink or paint bleeding through to the other side which means you can use both sides of the paper without any issues. This has been perfect for my young daughter who loves painting and drawing and lasts longer due to being able to use both sides of the paper. The sketch book is quite sturdy with nice solid covers and a spiral binding. Highly recommended. At the time of review the price is £14.65 which I feel is a little on the pricey side despite the high quality.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 January 2024","4.0 out of 5 stars"

This is a lovely spiral bound sketchbook.  I much prefer spiral bound art books, diaries as they are so much easier to use, if you want to come back to a page, so much easier to turn.  The paper is a great quality and is suitable for a variety of medias.  I took a pic and on the back tells you which medias they recommend.  The size makes it ideal for larger compositions and also for framing. If you are going to frame a sketch etc you really don't want some A6 piece of paper!!!Happy to recommend, this supplier does loads of other craft items, so will have to take a peak at the rest of these, I have a lot of very arts and crafty friends, and I make up arts and crafts bundles for their birthdays.  If you know it is something that someone uses on a regular present you are not cluttering up their house with something unwanted ...","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 December 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars"

I always think describing it as 70 pages is a bit misleading. Personally I only ever draw on one side so counting both sides does not seem right but hey ho. The pages come spiral bound between ridged covers the back cover is particularly sturdy which is good as it will protect your drawings even if you are carrying them around. The paper is A3 and is a good quality 150 gsm smooth cartridge type paper. At 150gsm it is not the thickest but it is as described and is certainly adequate for sketching. I usually use a thicker paper but found this worked pretty well.

The paper does what it says and works very well with fountain pen ink, not allowing any feathering etc. The ink didn’t get through to the other side of the page either. The pages look and feel excellent quality and are a bright white.Unfortunately it is a soft back notebook and after just week of use I’m starting to see wear. I don’t mind the back getting worn down but this in turn allows the pages inside to crease etc. I would also rather have grey lines than blue.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 January 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"111","Notebook","My Notes A4 Card Cover Wirebound Notebook, Ruled with Margin and Perforated, 200 Page, 1 Notebook Black","R Coleman","About a year ago I bought some Oxford Campus notebooks and found them excellent. I really like how my fountain pen looks on the pages, there's no bleeding unlike with other notebooks (e.g., Pukka Pads). Recently the Oxford Campus line was changed to include ""support"" for Oxford's Scribzee app, which I didn't want — there are ugly blue markers in the corners of all the pages of the new notebooks.Happily, this notebook is very similar to the old Oxford Campus ones; that is to say, it doesn't support Scribzee and has clean pages for you to do as you like with. One of the photos shows my old Campus notebook (left) next to this one (right). The paper is almost exactly the same between them (the old one looks a little grey as it's been in my bag for several months).Overall, I'm very happy. This is a quality notebook at a good price without any gimmicks like the Scribzee app.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 June 2018","4.6 out of 5 stars"

One cool thing about this book is that it has the function to use an app and take a photo! (could you tell I was being sarcastic?)However even if it is something as simple as taking a photo the app allows for easy and clean filing of work so that you can keep your notes on you anywhere you may go. (considering you bring your phone around with you)Overall good product, wish that it was a bit bigger but no biggie!","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 December 2016","5.0 out of 5 stars"
